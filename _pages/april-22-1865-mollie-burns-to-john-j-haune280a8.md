Dearest Friend,

You obey well, I was pleased to find Your letter awaiting my return, it arrived on Wednesday and myself, yesterday.

Jimmie C. has not called yet. Mollie will always treat your friends well and not only treat Jimmie well for your sake, but like him very much myself. Does he intend to stay in Louisville, or is he only passing through?

I was pleased to hear of your being with my sisters on Sunday last. What do you think of Mrs Jenkins, Charlie’s ma? I wish he was more like her. I believe I want to see Fannie’s three little ones and Charlie Boots worse than any of you all up there. But I want to see you mighty bad. I am getting a little homesick. I never could stay away very long at a time.

Such a blowing up—well, well, you know I could not get along without scolding a little, but we will let it all pass. I love to tease you so much, you don’t know how much I enjoy it or you would allow me the privilege, would you not? I never had any secrets from ma or pa, not that they were prying at tall, but I never do anything that I object to them knowing. I guess pa just took it for granted. You had heard from me I shall go and call on Cliff when I get to Midway. It was quite laughable what Mrs Lemon said indeed, but I think she was excusable under the circumstances.

Ruby is the name I like so well to hear you call me. It might not sound so well from anyone else, or other lips. I guess if Mrs Shelton should die Bob S. and Alice S. would marry.

The city here is still in mourning for Lincoln. We went down on the Morning Star, the boat you bad Rebels pressed into taking you over into Indiana. Captain Ballard told me you all like to have scared him to death. Blue River Island is just above where we got off, where Hines buried some of his men. I was delighted with the first Clerk, and had the pleasure of his attention down and up, in all my spare time. He was an acquaintance of my Cousin’s. We had a fine string band on board, some very pleasant young ladies, and a nice dance on our way back, but I did not care to be introduced to any stranger, consequently I held no conversation with any gentleman but the captain, the clerk and my cousin. We were on all night on our return, being delayed receiving freight. I slept very little, there was so much noise at the landings.

Cousin Sallie Hutchins and I went to two house parties. Their style of dress here I could better describe with my tongue, having more power to employ it to a better advantage than my pen, for instead light lawn dresses, they wore black skirts, bows of blue, red, and yellow ribbon in profusion, with no required to color or taste. Sallie and I being from the city had choice of the gentleman or course, if there was any choice. Of course WE put on all the style imaginable. We had our own fun. You, knowing girls’ vanity, will think our imagination had a great deal to do with it—but if we had been two live elephants we would not have been gazed at more. Now I know you all up there will say, yes just like her.

There is a great sensation in that portion of the country concerning oil, as they are boring for it have found some. But deliver me from Indiana, what little I seen of it. They told me on the boat what I might expect to see, but I told them on my return their descriptive powers failed to give me the least idea of the country till I had seen it. But there is a pretty good joke out on me. I have written home and told them about it. But I don’t believe I will tell you. Ask Dora if you would like to know—but I guess you are not that much interested.

Dora says she believes you love me, and you wish to know, what I think of it. Well I would not like to think otherwise. You can answer this letter. I may make a start for home the last of next week or the first of the following week. I have just commenced to make Cousin Mary a frame and will have it to finish. Cousin wants me to stay with her till the forth of June till her husband comes home like to be accommodating, but am getting a little home sick now.

I shall expect a letter. I may answer it with a letter, and I may answer it in person—which would you prefer? I know you would say in a letter just to be contrary, but I do not like to be teased if I do enjoy teasing myself. and especially from you. Cousin sends her well wishes, and says something else. I will not tell you what. I could not make out what was erased toward the last of your letter this time.

As ever your Friend,

M.C.B.

Your letter was open when Cousin got it out. Excuse the envelope.

- Mollie
