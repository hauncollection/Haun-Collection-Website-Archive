At Home Feb 8th 1864

My Friend
How shall I begin to write, having such a piece
of news to tell you. Aunt Ell and Mr Price, are at last married
after a courtship of six years. They have perchased the
house on the corner by us of Mr Mcdonnald, and
were married in their own house. I believe every boy
in town was there I did not know any thing about
it untill after breakfast, that morning and then
a party of us went to Lexington, with them. She
kept it very still. Mrs Webb told me at church yesterday
she had received a letter from your ma which she
intended forwarding to you, after answering it. She
has also received a second one from your friend
in Penn he spoke of writing to you, also your friend
Berty is growing very pretty indeed, She has learned
a new piece of musick, something about. {I love Dixy
write or wrong} and if I would come up She would
play it for me. The boys gave Aunt and Unckle
Price a beautifull serenade. She set quite a
table for them. E Connon is much better, some hopes
of his recovery Mrs Stoughten is liveing with them
Mr Mcdonnold haveing perchased whare she lived
Thornt Sinclair was put in the vault yesterday
died very sudenly, two days ilness, of the spotted
fever. Three or four have died of it in the neighbor
hood of the Stamp it is a dreadful disease. And
little Frank Lemon, is out expected to live through
the day, he talkes so much about his Pa. Tommie
is in very delicate health also, Poor Mrs Lemon
takes it so hard. His Pa being away, and he
was so devoted to him. We have our new Library
there is a consert at our church to night
all of our best singers, and a Gentleman and
his lady from Ohio, the proceedes to perchase a
Melodian for our church. Your letter was received
two weeks ago to day Monday. You tell one to bear
in mind it is leap year, and you will
answer all questions put to you. Well now I
am the last one to ask any questions. talk
abut starving to death by degrees. Dis child loves
to eat. two well for that. If you could see her I
know you would think so any way. Dora
tells one to give you her love. But I tell her
she shant send her love to you, But may
send her regards, but she still insists on
sending her love, She is looking every day for
her Paris Flame Lucian Denington he has
been two years in the [crossed out]Feder United States
servace, and is just from the army, one year
longer to serve Buddie is so mad because Dora
sacked him he will not speak to any of us
most of all the boys that are in the Fed army
from Georgetown are now here on ferlow. Gabbie
H is on a visit to Indianna. We have had
some of the coldest Weather ever felt in Kentucky
and some of the most beautifull, the last
two or three weeks, just like spring, it made
us think of visiting the old mill, and flowery
island, fishing and so on. But one of our
number I fear, who was always ready to go
with the girls, on such excursions, will be
sadly missed this sumoner. Beatty Blark
She is very low with the consumption Harry’s wife

just to think the thirdof this month was my
birth day. I suppose you rember my age, 22
being a member of the sister hood through necess
seems to stare me in the face like some grim
monster although rumor, untruthful madam
as she is, has me engaged to two or three difrent
persons. But then when, this cruel war is over, there
will be a few old Batchelors left {no insinuations
of course}. And then some of us may conclude
to disband our sister hood although there will
still be some left. I had quite a nice little
chat with Joe Elgin the other day, he inquired
after you, wished to know when I had heard
from you. I told him I must have been one of the
many friends of yours forgotten, as you had
never honored me with the scrach of a pen
yes he says I believe you are a truthful young Lady
But I was wish him as Mrs Well very ignorant
of your proceedings. That old fellow that came
in town from the crossings, with all that drove of
cattle, the day Will Webb was in the Court House has
acted just as hateful as Eaf, O. Johnnie S. and some
others, and is in the neighbor hood of Joe Lemon
John Lemon and some others, And you know he is such
a consumated old vilan that there is someplace
he will not let rest and with what he had left
is still colecting more and says he intends paying
us a visit again in the springs but they are preparing
to catch him, and I for one you know hope they

[sideways]
will of catch him I did not know wether you had heard it

[upside down]
and thought I would tell you Write directly you

[sideways]
get this, and believe me as ever your true Friend Mollie Burns
