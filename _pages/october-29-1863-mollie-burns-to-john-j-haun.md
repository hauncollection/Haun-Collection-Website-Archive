Dear Friend,

Your long looked for letter of the 21st was received one day before yesterday, and perused with great interest. I was sorry indeed to learn of your illness and pleased to hear of your recovery, for I should not judge that a Prison was a very desirable place in time of sickness.

Wallace and Howard Graves was taken  from our vault to the Newtown church where  their funeral was preached by Mr Young, and  they were then buried in the churchyard. There were about 150 carriages and buggies in attendance,  the longest procession I ever witnessed.

Jimmie Crumbaugh was there, and insisted on me going home with him. I went and stayed three days, and I assure you, Fannie Johnson him and I had a fine time. We attended old Mrs Crumbaugh’s sale. Mr Offutt put Fan and I up and we received one bid of fifteen cents by Cash Smith. By the way, we all went over on horse back to see old Harry and Fill. Jimmy brought me home on horseback. I tell you I think I will make quite a rider after while. He says he had written to you repeatedly but has received no answer. I supposed he did not direct right. I gave him your directions and the last time I seen him he told me he had written, but as you have been moved you may not get it. You must write to him.

Jimmie Hudron of the crossings was brought home a corpse to be buried a day or two ago. When he was taken sick, and the doctors had given him up they wanted him to take the oath[note]An oath of allegiance to the United States, demanded of captured Confederate soldiers.[/note] and be brought home, but no, he declared he would rather die in prison, and so he did. Rich Johnson and Dr Smith’s son, Jimmie, I think, have taken it and are now at home. Thornt Crumbaugh is in Canada. He took french leave[note]Unsanctioned leave; in effect, a deserter or escapee.[/note] of Camp Douglass. Hat was there with the boys, but all have returned. He sent me a verse which was as follows:

Oh no we must not shall not part
you are the life blood of my heart

so I thought as he was so anxious, I would speak. So yesterday I met him on the street I slightly inclined my head from its usual dignity and received quite a gracious bow. Madam Rumor says Hat and your cousin are preparing to mary. She also states that Mrs West is buying up eggs to prepare for an infare[note]A wedding reception.[/note] but I do not know if it is correct. Mr Ed Applegate joined the Reform church last night and was immersed this morning.

I was trying think who had died since you left that you perhaps had not heard of. Will White and Mr Noah Spears have lost their wives. Old Mrs Adams died a few days after Mr Dock Barclay who was shot by Jimmie Robertson. We heard through a letter that Ganoe Pia wrote a letter to his Ma, that came through with a flag of truce, that John Lemon and John Vernor, two Beatty boys, and another of the Scott boys were in this last Chickamauga Battle[note]Battle of Chickamauga, September 19 - 20 1863.[/note] and got through safe.

You ask if Mat S. drinks as hard as ever. Yes and worse. Danville and Bardstown and one or two other places around us have been disturbed like we were, the day Will Webb and some others were put in the court house. But Mike Barlow, George Cantrill and others who were concerned before in the disturbance were, as you will guess, not the ring leaders this time but another set altogether.

Frank Anlghire and I are going down to Mr Timan’s to stay a week on Saturday. We were down on Sunday last, and promised to return on Saturday and spend a week. I should like to take you along; won’t you go. Or is Uncle Sam’s finger holding you too tight? I expect he is. Dora said she would like to see you. She and Buddie have called it quits.  He is at home.

I am all curiosity to see my ring. The idea of its being made in prison enhances the beauty of it, of course. You intend to commit another theft do you, if opportunity offers? Well we will see.

Ellen S. and I spent the day at Fannie’s on Tuesday. She is not teaching at present. You speak of showing my letter to a messmate by way of retaliation. Well I write such a beautiful hand, and so correctly, of course you are proud of them. I do not entertain any serious fears of many retaliations of that sort. Well as I have a letter to write to Alice, and cannot think of any more news to tell you.

I close subscribing myself your True Friend,

Mollie C Burns

P.S. Chalk says if you want another letter wight soon from her, answer this as soon as received Mollie
