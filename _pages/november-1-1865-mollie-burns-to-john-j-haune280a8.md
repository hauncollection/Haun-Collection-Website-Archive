Mr Haun, dearest one,

As we are invited to attend the society tomorrow night, and have a dress body to make tomorrow to wear, and consequently will not have any other time to write to you I will embrace the present opportunity—for you say it is a pleasure you look forward to, the reception of my letters and I do not wish to deprive you of that pleasure, when avoidable.

Yours arrived on Monday evening but the tenor of some parts is rather amusing. You pretend to be terribly afraid of Dick. Well he sent a card on Friday, and  I did not receive him. He sent one the following Saturday. I then received him; he also made an engagement for Sunday, and then I received a letter which I did not answer. I shall always be pleased to see him but intend to cease the correspondence. You think I am so fickle as to change the love of one I think would be constant truce and never forsake for another untried. But Dick is in the background while Mr Woolman takes the lead. He is more devoted than the former; he sent me the nicest bottle of wine all fixed up in ribbon and comes twice a week to see me, what do you think of that? But I never could make you jealous—and I try so hard, thinking there is more love existing when a little such feeling is deployed.

Cousin F. sends her kindest regards and says she is watching the corners for you. I some times think it would be better, as you say, if I should become enamored elsewhere. Those words, are words I never liked coming from you, that perhaps it were better if we had never met. I have always been accustomed to having lovers sue, or sigh for a love I never gave. It sounds rather strange to me to hear one, say or seem, as though it were a matter of small importance, to be rejected or not just as circumstances will. I am rather high minded in such matters you know full well and perhaps, you may think from the tone of this letter I am undergoing a chance in sentiment, whilst I remain the same.

I received two letters from Dora this week in which she has forwarded letters received for me there. I am glad to hear that Joe and Millie N. are fairly launched in matrimony and wish them a long and happy life. You ask when I expect to return. I do not know. Cousin Fannie is fussing because I told her I intended to return home when Mr King came. She wants me receive him here but I prefer receiving my friends in my own home. She has a great deal to do and says I have got to stay with her till she gets through. I may, and then I may not, just as the notion takes me. We will always be pleased to see you whenever you choose to come. I have seen Clifford this evening. She has been quite sick but is better at present. I can scarcely write the children are keeping up such a noise. I hardly know what I have written here, but you must puzzle it out.

In haste, but none the less fondly,

Mollie

P.S. Write soon
