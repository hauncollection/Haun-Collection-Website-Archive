...to the fair. I have been over to see her. Poor thing, how I pity her. She is so confused and they have got nothing in the world. They will have to leave that place this fall. Fran has taken the insolent act. He does nothing in the world to make a living. I cannot see what they are going to do if she comes over. I will try and get her to stay with me this winter for I cannot see what she is to do. I did not go in the house at Ward’s but drove up to the gate and got her and the children and went to Mrs Chip’s and stayed all night and started home in the morning.

Your pa wrote a long letter to Lizzie’s pa telling him her situation. We did not know where to direct it and I wrote a few lines to Mr Moore and sent the letter to him, requesting him to send it to John. You can see them and hear what your pa wrote, but keep these things in the family. I felt it my duty to go and see for myself her situation.

Your pa and I have given you all the news worth relating, as he has written you a long letter. We get the papers and the Harbinger, which is a great pleasure to us indeed. Tell Sara H. West I will write to her as soon as the fair is over.

I have been better contented this year than I have ever been in California. I have got an agreeable girl living with me. I have more company and go about more than I ever have, and another reason is you are with the Negroes to take care of them and can enjoy yourself if you will.

You do not say a word...
