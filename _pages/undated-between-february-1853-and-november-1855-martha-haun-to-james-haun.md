...mind to hear it with all the fortitude I possibly can another year. You must then come home or send word for me to come.

Mr Moore says whenever you write to me to go out, that you intend staying there, and I want me to come. Then, he will do anything in his power to get me off and will assist me to go any way he can but he says I ought not to think of going unless you wrote positively for me to do so. I am willing to do what you think is for the best. Dave lost his trunk at Louisville. I did not get it until last Monday. He was expected to get it—

I wrote you in a previous letter that Louis Offutt and the widow Patterson were married. Old Henry Prewett is married to a Mrs Walker of Louisville. He is her third husband. She is fifty four years of age and has four children, all grown but one boy twelve years old. He is with them. She is a very nice woman. Lou Chambers is anxious to go to California. She says she will go if ever she gets money enough to take her— Tom Holtzclaw has just left. He come in to see if I would board him a few days until they get ready to leave. They are in a bad fix. Old Henry has left them the bag to hold. They must get away the best way they can. The poor old woman is nearly crazy.

The church is in a very luke warm condition at present. No one is preaching for us but old brother Smith. The old man will make me read all your letters to him. He says you write so satisfactory, he loves to hear them read. He always sends his love to you.

Dave tells me John has grown a great deal. Tell the little scamp he must not grow and change so much I won’t know him when he gets back. I want him to look like my own precious boy when he comes. You may well know I asked Dave a few questions about you.
Now, let me say to you, for my sake do not come across the plaines when you start for home but please come the quickest way--and one other thing: do not take me by surprise, for it would overcome me too much. It would be too much for my nerves. Let me know when you are coming, and when you get to Cincinnati or Louisville telegraph me. Please comply with this request. Let me get a letter two weeks at least before you come.
Mrs Weeb is pestering me all the time. She just sent word to know if I was going to perfume my letter and what with. She said she had just sent her husband one and perfumed it. He is in the South. I must stop this nonsense and bid you goodbye for this time.

My own precious husband. Oh how I would like to send you a kiss--my life, my love, my all. Farewell! Tell my boy I will write him by the next mail. Write me often.

Your devoted wife until I cease to exist,

M. Haun
