Dear Friend,

I received your welcome and anxiously looked for letter the day before yesterday. It was dated the first of September. It is useless to say anything of the pleasure it gives me to receive a letter from you. Of course it is a great satisfaction to hear from our friends at home--in truth, you might say it is the only enjoyment we prisoners have. Of course I will consider your letter an answer to both of mine, but think it is hardly fair. But I will make a bargain with you to write two for every one you send me and think I have made a good bargain at that.

You read my letter to Mr Lemon did you? “Just like you” instead of committing it to the flames where all such documents should go. But you always would have your way. However I suppose you did right as I made mention of them in my letter. I heard Mr Lemon was killed Atlanta over a card table but did not mention it, fearing it would cause them a great deal of trouble and unnecessary uneasiness as it came to me in a very indirect way and I could not place any confidence in the report. I hope it is not true. Have they heard from him since he left home? We parted at Knoxville, he going to Atlanta I to New Market Station to Buford’s Brigade[note]Union Major General John Buford of Kentucky, who famously fought at Gettysburg.[/note], where I remained about three weeks with some of my acquaintances, and after which took charge of some cattle with Mr Ed Cantrell until February. I suppose you heard James Cantrell was wounded at Greasy Creek, Kentucky[note]Consult the <a title="Map" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/map/">map</a> for precise location.[/note] by a piece of shell in the shoulder but is well now.

How is Hat and cousin Sallie progressing now? Lovely I suppose. Do you speak to him or not? I hope you and him will make friends again, as I believe I was partly the cause of coolness between you. I admire Mr Steadman but not Miss Raulins’ taste. She will answer for father and husband both but I think not much of that latter. See what money will do--you know my opinion of such matters. What Matt Saunders is it you speak of? Surely not the man that married Gabbie Ross, for I heard he was numbered among the dead long since. Tell Billie G he had better mind who he abuses in these war times; he might be called on account some day. I am glad to learn Silas has such a good school. I would like to make one of the number very much. A man forgets everything he ever did learn soldiering.

My Tennessee sweetheart does not resemble Lizzie T. very much, being much prettier, of course, and a little larger than M.C.B., but not so pretty. By the way, Mary is a favorite name with me. I never knew one by that name but what possessed all the qualities requisite to a lady. Perhaps I had better stop lest you think I am going into ecstasies over a name. There is something in a name, Shakespeare to the contrary. She used to sing the favorite song to me... And “Oh twill be sweet to remember when I am far far from thee, that the hand of fate only can sever my lasting affection for thee.”[note]Lyrics from “Come Dearest the Daylight is Gone” by Brinley Richards.[/note] Ask Tingle to sing it for you, he knows it.

It would seem Paris had some great attraction for you I think for Mr. McCally is the sole cause of so much visiting, young and good looking of course. Give me a bid to the wedding won’t you? I like to hear of your giving yourself “go it while young.”

Perhaps a description of Prison Number 3 will be interesting. It is an important place of late. Number 3 contains over three acres of ground enclosed by a fence about fifteen feet high containing 69 houses in a straight line three deep with streets running in front of each house. Each house contains from fifteen to twenty prisoners with settlers stores in the opposite side near the entrance, where we are supplied with a few necessaries such as tobacco, pipes, paper &amp;c.

If you think I write such a pretty hand I would suggest that you employ me as private secretary to do your writing for you. I am out of employment. Mollie I got the blues sometimes when I think of my situation. You know I am subject to them frequently.
Give my kindest regards to Mrs L. and Tom. Ask Tom if he is acquainted with a Mr. Crimes of Clark County. He is here. I must close for want of space. I am making a fancy ring intended for you and will send it by letter if I can, when it is finished. Do try and find time enough to answer this. Respects to Dora and friends. Goodbye for the present, while I remain yours &amp;c.,

J.J. Haun

I live on Shenault Street. Put the no of Barracks on your letter, as it will be more certain to arrive.
