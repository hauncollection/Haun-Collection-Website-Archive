John and I took the first boat to shore with many others. I stood in water up to the top of my boots as she took in water, but we landed safe in Virgin Bay Town. We dined and waited for day, and, after getting our mules, we set out 12 miles for the Pacific. After passing over one of the most singular countries, and steep mountains, and by all sorts evergreens and fruits, and the natives living in houses made of round sticks and Bamboo cane and covered with flag leaves, we next landed safe at the Pacific Hotel after dark and we paid for supper, breakfast.

<strong>March 5</strong> - Lodging and dinner, each $2.50. Arrived in the town of San Juan del Sea.

<strong>Sunday 6</strong> - I got up early took a stroll. The Brother Jonathan[note]A paddle steamer built in 1851 and purchased by Cornelius Vanderbilt in 1852. Crashed off the coast of Crescent City, CA in 1865[/note] is lying at anchorage a few hundred yards out, opposite our hotel.

In looking around at the high cliffs I saw cactuses 6 inches in diameter and 8 or 10 feet high. I had liked to forgotten to mention the mile high mountains in Lake Nicaragua3 and the clouds hanging around their top. I saw many natives stark naked, and good sweat oranges, 1 cent apiece.

Here it is considered the Fall season. The road we traveled over yesterday was quite dry and dusty, though it rained every day, when we first landed at the mouth of the San Juan river (it is spelled Juan). After Breakfast, we went in a-bathing.

Our trunks is coming in all well.

The first thing that saluted my ears was the breakers of the sea at this place. They continue and continue to roar while I write, standing near the water’s edge.

<strong>March 6</strong> - to oranges and lemons, $1.00
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">to passage on steamer, each $2.50</span>

<strong>Wednesday 9</strong> - After sunset. Quite warm all day. The Pacific quite smooth. All's well. Today we crossed the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Today I saw a number of black fish.

<strong>Thursday 10</strong> - 8 o’clock in the morning. Saw a steamer going in the opposite direction. Dry, warm and clear--has not rained on us since the night of the 3rd, the last night we was on the San Juan River. We will pass Acapulco today.

At night. Have just seen quite a number of porpoises and occasionally a shark. I saw the sunset in the water this evening and opposite the town of Acapulco after sunset.

<strong>Friday 11</strong> - Quite pleasant all day with a gentle breeze ahead.

<strong>Saturday 12</strong> - Warm and sultry with heavy swells. Many passenger were not at breakfast. I feel out of sorts, kind of squeamish, too sick to eat dinner. The wind is from the North West, getting cool. I had to put on my vest. Could not eat supper. We are crossing the Gulf of California.

<strong>Sunday 13</strong> - Quite unwell this morning. The vessel continues to role about. Ate nothing all day. Had preaching. The text was Matthew 16.24, verses 5 and 6---

<strong>Monday 14</strong> - Crossed the Gulf of California. The sea is calmer. Ate breakfast, but very weak. Had to put on my over coat and socks again. Saw three whales and three sharks this morning. Now, we are less than 2 miles of Margarito Island to the East, and not a shrub to be seen on it. Ate three meals today.

As I want none, I will wait their return. Much of this town is built out in the bay on spiling. There is a great amount of shipping here. At half past ten I walked up to town and breakfasted. I called for 3 eggs, 75 cents, making in all $1.37 ½.

We next went aboard the steamer Comanche8 for Marysville at $10 each, and meals at $1.50 each. We started at 1/2 past 1 o’clock at the narrows in the bay. Above 35 miles up is Benicia the capital of state. These bay shores is beautiful. The many hills seems to have been harrowed rolled and set in grass without a stump or tree. Passed Benicia 1 hour Sunday evening.

At 4 o’clock this morning we were at Sacramento wharf. I went ashore at daylight and got breakfast at 50 cents.

At 8 o’clock we started again after the steamers Page and Gove Dany for Marysville. The Page blew up 10 miles below Marysville. We arrived there about 4:00 in the afternoon and went out to H.P.’s[note]James’ younger brother Henry Peter Haun, a Marysville attorney had come California overland from Kentucky in 1849. He and his family owned a ranch and grew fruit. Although no hard evidence survives, its likely that H.P's successes, detailed in his letters home, may have inspired his brothers to follow in his footsteps. Consult the people list for a brief <a title="H.P. Haun" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/list-of-people/#H.P.%20Haun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">biography</a>.[/note] Ranch and remained there until the Friday 17th of June.
