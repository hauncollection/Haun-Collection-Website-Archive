Dearest Mollie,

I received your very welcome but short letter last evening. How eager I was to see its contents, so much so I could hardly take time to eat my supper. It gave me great pleasure to learn you were well but plague take that obstreperous tooth. I just wish you would let me have my way with it for a little while. It wouldn’t bother you any more soon I know. I saw your sweetheart the other day, or rather my good looking rival. I have one consolation at any rate: if I am ousted it will be by a fine looking fellow. He was not dress ed as nicely as when he was at Midway.

I have just come from Ives' wedding, and a nice time I had of it too. There was a large crowd to witness it. I had lots of fun. Dave Adams and Miss Coyle waited on them. They were married by McGinn. Everything was very well conducted. There was a fine table in the shape of a cross and some of the town boys were there: Frank. Will White, Dick Weeks, Pres West, J. Shermitt and Tingle had plenty to eat and drink. Tom L. was not there although her ma says Joe insisted on her being present to see the last of him. She promised Mrs Taylor she would accompany her home and of course had to do it. I saw a good many of my connections there. I did not attend the infare, it being a very disagreeable evening. Seeing them put me in the notion of doing so. For goodness sake, come home and lets get married. Or can’t you stand the press just now? Do not put the wrong construction on the above.

I called to see Dora and Cliff’s ma as I passed through town. Mollie, Mrs Webb has been quizzing me again in regard to yourself. She found out by some means I had been to Midway and everyone here has commenced anew about us. They just swear we are going to marry forth with, but I tell them it is all a mistake on purpose. Mr Webb says she told the person that informed her I had been to see you that I could not have gone to see a prettier or nicer girl but I only laughed at her and took it for what it was worth, as I thought she only wished to find out what I would say. She says you used to feel very solicitous for my welfare while in prison and that you used to tell her when you would hear from me, which was very kind of you indeed. She speaks very highly of you always to me, but I had a notion of telling her you did not  know Dick then, or else she wouldn’t of heard so often perhaps.

It was a pleasant evening when I came home, but my ride was anything else but pleasant as there was quite a ringing in my head all the way, being a very peculiar noise which made me very uneasy sounding all the time like Dick, Dick, Dick...

I left with a very heavy heart as I told Dora and evil forebodings. Do you you blame me for feeling sad and troubled in mind, but probably I will survive it as is said time over comes all things.

I met Mrs Jenkins and Mr Barbee at Cliff’s ma’s. She was sick in bed. When I told her I saw Cliff Mrs Jenkins said, “we can guess where he’s been.” I told Dora I was not going over to Midway any more as I was superseded completely. Give my regards to Mr and Mrs H and tell her I enjoyed my visit finely while at her house, that I shall never forget it and especially the treat she gave us. She treated me so well I will be apt to call again—but I do think she ought to have shown me that pretty picture before I left.

You spoke of being unworthy of my regard. Mollie, I think you worthy of the love of any m an and more especially one that has known you as long as I have and has had the opportunity of knowing your many, yes, very many virtues. I know I do vex you sometimes and have done and said things I ought not to have done and of course it was my own fault if you were mad with me. I have always tried never to do or say anything calculated to wound your kind and sensitive heart, for I do think you posses such a one. On the other hand you have never said or acted otherwise than the perfect lady towards me. If so I have failed to discover it. That one thing has caused you to stand very high in my estimation: you are kind and courteous to all. I know you have as many friends as any lady of my acquaintance.

I must close Mollie. Write again when you feel like it and I assure you no one would be better to pleased to get your letters, not even Dick. I have not written home yet. I will take your advice and wait until I receive one from home.

Frank Kenney is dead. Ezra Offutt’s daughter is married to another Mundy they are similar to the Nutters they believe in Wests and the Offutts in Mundys. The town is void of all news but I suppose Dora keeps you pretty well posted in that particular. Tell me in your next when you are coming home. I told your pa I understood he was going to move to the country. He said he was afraid he would be disappointed. He said it looked like there was no way of separating you and Fannie Kershaw, you had taken such a liking to each other of late. Mr Will sends his regard to you. Write soon. May God protect you Mollie is my sincere wish from one that loves you devotedly until death.

J.J. Haun

P.S. Jimmie is at home sick with the measles. He has been very sick but is getting better. We thought he would die at one time. Ever thine.
