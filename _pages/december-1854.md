<strong>Friday 1</strong> - Breakfast and lodging $1. Before sunrise I was on the road for Marysville, a distance of 19 miles, which which I made before noon. I paid $1.50 for whiskey I had a mule ride 6 miles I then went to Row &amp; Haun’s office and had a consultation about my suit, in which they both said there would be no difficulty in gaining it for me in the supreme court, only I had to send back the papers and have them maid out anew on paper of a certain kind before they would be admitted in that court. I paid $1.50 for paper and $1 for the express to take it back. I then went to the stable to Derick. He did not know me for some time. I went home with H.P. Cath[note]H.P.’s wife and cousin, Catherine Margaret Haun. The couple married on October 27 1848.[/note] is not well, quite feeble, and little Cath has got the chills and the nerves. H.P. is not in good health either. Derick is well.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Cloudy the last two days.</span>

<strong>Saturday 2</strong> - H.P. and I went to town and stayed all day. I gave 25 cents for grapes to eat and got acquainted with Bob Bowen whom Dave called “little Bub,” &amp;c. So we two went home with the judge at dark. Cloudy today.

<strong>Sunday 3 </strong>- Rained all day. Bowen asked me to loan him $1000 at 3 per cent a month, and he would make me safe by mortgage. I agreed to send it down as soon as practicable. We stayed all day at the Judge’s ---

<strong>Monday 4</strong> - Bowen started home. I and the Judge went to town and then to the post office. I got two letters, one from my wife dated October 18 1854[note]Martha Haun's letter of October 181 854 has been preserved and is available <a title="October 18 1856" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/version-iii-series-ii/october-18-1854-martha-haun-to-james-haun/">here</a>.[/note] giving an account of old Ben Ford’s death, and the reception of a bill of exchange for $200, and her determination to remain in Kentucky for the present, and one from Lizzy of October 25[note]Lizzie Hurst's letter of October 25 1854 has been preserved and is available <a title="October 25 1854" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/version-iii-series-ii/october-25-1854-lizzie-hurst-to-james-haun/">here</a>.[/note], which says she wants us to come home in the spring, if we could.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I stayed in town all day. After dinner Jack came in. He did not know me at first. I went out with the Judge at dark, &amp;c ---</span>

<strong>Tuesday 5</strong> - Jack came out before breakfast. I and the judge went to town, he on the hunt of beef cattle, and I to get two gum coats, white $16; and two pair of gum overalls, $6; one cover to a hat, $1; two red flannel shirts, $3.50; four pair socks, $2; one pair gum boots, $7; five fiddle strings; and a pair of tweezers, $1.25. I left Row $30 to pay the entrance fee of suit to the clerk of the supreme court, and 25 cents for grapes. I slept in the stable was quite sick all night.

<strong>Wednesday 6</strong> - Paid $10 to ride up to the Columbus House in the stage. Cold and foggy at Marysville. Dinner $1 at the Oregon House. We got to the Columbus at 8 o’clock P.M. I took supper, $1, and went to bed, $.50, and took breakfast, $1.

<strong>Thursday 7</strong> - I gave $6 to ride a mule to Gibsonville and got my dinner there, $1, at 2:00 P.M. I then had to foot it two miles home which I did arriving a little after dark, carrying quite a pack. I spent 50 cents for whiskey at the Point.

<strong>Friday 8</strong> - We all went to work including Cook, a hired man. We cleaned off tailing and top dirt, but did not clean up our boxes. All well. Weather clear and cool. The moon has just rose above the hills, and the men have turned into their bunks. I will soon follow.

<strong>Saturday 9 </strong>- Quite cool of nights and mornings, so much so that our water in the ditch is nearly blocked up with ice till noon when the sun melts the ice some. Shaw, John, I, and Cook, a young man that we hire, were striping today, though we got gold  $2.50. Lloyd and Lawrence continued striping.

<strong>Sunday 10</strong> - Cool and clear. We divided our dust from the last two weeks, getting $111.50 per share, after paying $23 for the company for hired help to John Bull. My lost time amounted to $28. For two pairs of gum gloves I paid $3.50. I wrote a letter to H.P. and sent him a check for $1,500 by F.H. Everett &amp; Co. Express to be loaned at 3 per cent a month. I bought an ax and handle, paid $3, whiskey 50 cents &amp;c. My lesson is the 10th Chapter of Matthew ---

<strong>Monday 11</strong> - All six of us were at work on the ditch, covering it to keep it from being filled up with snow and breaking the levy, as was done last year. John is 20 years old today, and John Lloyd 50.

<strong>Tuesday 12</strong> - The nights are quite cold, so much so that the water is frozen considerably in the ditch. Where it is covered it does not freeze.

<strong>Wednesday 13</strong> - Still putting brush over the ditch. Six men have been at work on the ditch for four days each. The nights cold and days warm. The yellow jackets are flying about at noon. The wind does not blow the least bit, only its clouding up for rain or snow.

<strong>Thursday 14</strong> - We finished covering the ditch with brush. Delightful sunshine, very pleasant to work.

<strong>Friday 15</strong> - I and Lawrence was cleaning rocks out the ditch till noon. The other four was setting up the boxes and hose and cutting down some small trees and brush off the diggins. After dinner four of us got gold $44. The sun shines warm and pleasant. I paid 25 cents for paper tax ---

<strong>Saturday 16</strong> - I, Shaw, Lloyd, and Levi Lawrence gathered up six picks, and each one of them gathered their gum boots, and I took John’s, so that we had four pairs in all, and we went over to Betsey Town. He had the boots half soled with leather, cost $2.50, and the picks steeled and sharpened.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I met a woman in company with a man dressed in men's clothes and riding straddle. She is quite common stock. Another woman has left her husband, one of the proprietors of U.S. Hotel in Betsy Town, and gone with her lover. This took place some three weeks ago.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">My dinner and supper $2, plus lodging.
(Two men worked one day each on the ditch, 2 others one  half day each.)</span>

<strong>Sunday 17</strong> - After breakfast, $1, we started for home and arrived at 1 o’clock. We took dinner and went down to the Point. The county clerk had made out the papers again on the right kind of paper for my suit with Vaughn. I sent them by Everett’s Express to Marysville, to Row and Haun. &amp;c. Cost 50 cents. My lesson is Matthew, Chapter 21.

<strong>Monday 18</strong> - Four of us went to work at our diggins. The water soon ran out where Levi and Lloyd were at work, on account of the reservoir being at their chocked up by the cold, and no rain or snow to raise the break. The nights are cold and the water freezes. The days are dry and pleasant. We had to stop work till noon. We then had water till night and made $28. Levi and Lloyd do not weigh their gold till the close of the week, &amp;c.

<strong>Tuesday 19 </strong>- We was ready for work betimes as usual, but there was no water to work with.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Shaw, Lloyd and Lawrence went up the ditch to the bear trap and took out what is called a “cat.”[note]Likely a Fisher cat or wolverine.[/note] His front is grey and the hind part of his body grows gradually black. His long bushy tail, his legs and feet, his head, eyes and ears resemble those of a bear. They lassoed him in the trap and choked him till quite dead. Then they tied him before he came to again. We got some coarse wire and made a chain.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I paid off Cook for 12 days work $24. I went down to the Point with him. I returned at noon. After dinner I and John cut and split some wood, as none of the company worked in the diggins.</span>

<strong>Wednesday 20 </strong>- After breakfast I, John, Lloyd, Shaw, and Lawrence and two other men who are prospecting near our cabins all concluded to go down to Rich Bar and cross over Feather River and up Winters Creek. We tied up some bread and meat in a handkerchief to eat. We went right over Slate Mountain. It was very difficult to get down, I had to hold on to the rocks and bushes. We went up Winters Creek and arrived at the place where crystallized quarts has been got. I picked up a piece and took it to my cabin. We spent the day in climbing over the mountains and ravines.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Lloyd went up the river to the Point and got a letter for himself and one for John dated October 25 1854[note]Not included in this collection.[/note] from his ma. She said a great deal about our coming home in the Spring, and about a conversation she had with Littiss. There was also a letter for me from my wife dated November 13 1854[note]Martha Haun's letter of November 13 1854 has been preserved and is available <a title="November 13 1854" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/version-iii-series-ii/november-13-1854-martha-haun-to-james-haun/">here</a>.[/note], giving an account of her unhappy situation in being separated from us. She wants us to come home in the spring any how.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Well, we have not worked any today on account of the water being froze up. The nights are cold but the days is so delightful.</span>

<strong>Thursday 21</strong> - Cold nights and pleasant days. The first thing we done was to plague our pet until he broke the chain and none of us could catch him again. He is free again, except a collar around his neck and some little chain to it.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We did nothing at mining. I and John was getting wood. We cut up the tree that lay just behind our cabin and split some of it, &amp;c., &amp;c.</span>

<strong>Friday 22</strong> - Last night a man came up after Shaw, telling him to go down to his ranch. Accordingly this morning he started. Hannibal Bray came up according to appointment. Two others and myself took a tramp over the mountains but made no new discoveries. I was at home by 2:00 P.M. I ate dinner and split wood until night.

<strong>Saturday 23</strong> - I, John Lloyd and Lawrence was all at work. We had plenty of water. John and I got gold $7.50. Lloyd and C. did not weigh. It was somewhat cloudy today.

<strong>Sunday 24</strong> - Warm and cloudy, with wind blowing from the South. I split some wood that lay near my door and piled it up in anticipation of rain and snow. I finished my 16th letter to my wife and went down to the Point and mailed it (25 cents) and got a letter (50 cents) from H.P. acknowledging the receipt of a check for $1,500. I got John a hickory shirt for $1, and then got drink and went home. I gave $3.50 for whiskey.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I did wrong. I own up, and ask for forgiveness.</span>

<strong>Monday 25</strong> - Christmas morning. Up before day and built up a fire. I would like to catch my wife again in a Christmas gift. A little two far off. Cloudy, and wind blowing from the South. My lesson is the 8th Chapter of Mark. All four of us went to work. I and John got gold $57.50. It rained some in the forenoon. In the afternoon it was somewhat cloudy with sunshine at intervals, and all clear by bedtime.

<strong>Tuesday 26</strong> - Cold last night. Charles Allen, one of Shaw’s friends came to my cabin after dark. I hired him to work for Shaw while he is gone. So, we three got gold $21. It snowed a little in the evening and after dark the ground is a little white.

<strong>Wednesday 27</strong> - Cloudy last night, but no snow fell of consequence. It is somewhat cloudy today, but quite cool. We three got gold $10.50.

<strong>Thursday 28 </strong>- So cold last night that the water in the ditch froze up entirely. I, John and Charles were clearing off the ground of brush and small trees, and burning some heaps that we made last winter. Lawrence and Lloyd was at the same in the morning. They went up to the trap before dinner and found another cat in it. After dinner John went up to get it out, but choked it to death. Its of no account ---

<strong>Friday 29</strong> - Cold. The water is still froze up in the ditch. I and John were getting wood today ---

<strong>Saturday 30</strong> - Last night it was cold, but its warm today and somewhat cloudy. We finished off cutting and splitting wood, done up in good style. We went out and mended up our log heaps. John washed three shirts, a towel, and pair of socks for me, and some for himself. He had cleaned the table and furniture before, so we are in good shape for the New Year. After supper I washed myself, and then a pair of socks, and then went to bed. Lawrence and Charles went over to the American Valley after his blankets and other fixtures. They got back a little after dark.

<strong>Sunday 31</strong> - Warm and cloudy. Snow commenced before day. Sometime after breakfast I, John and Lawrance went up the ditch to look after the water. It was making its way down slowly. While we were up there it commenced raining and left off snowing. After returning we took diner and supper at the same time. Lloyd went down to the Point and has not returned. It continued to rain all day and late at night there was thunder. My lesson is the first chapter of St. Luke. I read four chapters and did some mending to my old duds, &amp;c.
