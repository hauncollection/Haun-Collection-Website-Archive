Mr Haun, dearest one,

We are still in Lexington but expect to go down to the city tomorrow at noon, or at least make a start for that destination. We have enjoyed ourselves remarkably well. Several ladies and gentleman come up for us yesterday evening and we went out to the lunatic asylum and went all through. It is one of the dismalest places I have ever seen. Dr Chiplyson the proprietor told me Richie Stevenson was considerably better. He made his escape and got down into town. He was trying to borrow money to buy something to eat when they found him. There are many mad looking spectacles, indeed.

Mr Cozin, Willie Price, Bert McLally, Mr Merker, Charlie Johnson and his brother too, Mr McMulagin, Mr Ring Winkle, all old friends, and a host of kind boys, so you see we do not lack for attendants but have company to go with us any where we want to go. Bert wants to know if he can't put my Georgetown beau out of the way. I told him it would take just about a dozen such as him to accomplish that. But he went to the reform church with me Sunday evening we attended the baptism in the morning. There is a protestant meeting at our church, conduction by a minister from Richmond, Virginia. Hatty Aubry has called on us. Also Frank Taner. We are going out to the cemetery on our return.
I have set tomorrow week as our date for returning  to Lexington. We will then stay here a few days and then go to Woodford. You must write so I can hear from you on my return from Covington.[note]Consult the <a title="Map" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/map/">map</a> for precise location.[/note]

I wish you were enjoying this trip around with us. I wrote to ma on Monday—did you hear her speak of receiving it? I was sorry to hear of Billie’s misfortune.
I have had a very sore throat from getting wet in that old stage but am about well now. It is the first cold I have had this summer.

Much love to Frank R. Lady and Sister Tess—tell her to take great care of my sweetheart but not to steel him entirely away. Aunt and cousin laugh at Dora and myself about a little walking breaking us down and wonder what we will do in the city. I weighed myself and what do you think? I weighted the whole amount of one hundred five 1/2 pounds. You would not have, such a poor little girl would you. Never mind, I intend to eat a heap and get fat. But bad pen ink and still poorer writing...

I will stop. I may write to you while at C. and may not, till I get back. With much, very much, love to you I remain as ever, your own loving Mollie, who has almost concluded she has no pleasure unmixed without thee, as she often thinks how she would like to have you along.

But with a kiss, goodbye,

Mollie C. Burns
