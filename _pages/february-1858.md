<strong>Monday 1</strong> - Carter started for Bidwell’s Bar to bring in the mail. I bought 6 gallons whiskey, paid $13.50, and a bottle besides cost $1, all to be used by our cook.

<strong>Tuesday 2</strong> - Down to Saturday the 6th it is one round of fine days: warm sun and pleasant, but cold nights. John got back of Friday the 5th and so did Carter, with the mail. I got a letter from L.M. Thurman dated December 23rd 1857 from Knox City, Illinois. He says he wants to come back.

<strong>Saturday 6</strong> - John Bass made me a present of a pair of pants on Friday last —

<strong>Sunday 7</strong> - A beautiful morning after a cold, frosty night. the Black smith is at work sharpening some poor miner’s pick, I suppose.

<strong>Monday 8</strong> - Snowed some last night and a little today, then cleared off again. Nothing doing.

<strong>Tuesday 9</strong> - Very cold last night. I paid $.50 for candles last night. At noon there was a fight between one Thos Hogan and George Miller, in which Miller got cut about the head with a knife. Then Miller got his knife out and made Hogan run, as his knife was not fit for use, being bent double. Hogan was arrested. I and Maston went his bail.

<strong>Wednesday 10</strong> - Last night was cold, and today warm. I wrote a letter to L.M. on Thurman. Miller is laying about with his head tied up.

<strong>Thursday 11</strong> - Cold last night and warm today, with some appearance of snow. My wife sold 18 chickens for $27 and gave me $20 of the money and $1 to buy a broom. I let Bass and Neal have 2 dozen eggs at $2.50.

<strong>Friday 12</strong> - Carter left for Bidwell’s Bar with the U.S. Mail. The weather is clear and cold.

<strong>Saturday 13</strong> - No change of importance to note. I sold J.C. Lewis 58 pounds wheat on time.

<strong>Sunday 14</strong> - It snowed some last night and continued all day very fast. I was on a jury to try the right of property and received $3 for a verdict, all in cash on Friday last.

<strong>Monday 15</strong> - Up before day. The ground is again covered with snow as well as the trees. It looks dreary indeed. It continued all day snowing with intervals of rain. Last night, it appears to have rained all night but not so fast as it has been all of today. It is quite slushy on the ground, with snow and water.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">The sheriff’s sale took place today. They are selling out a Jew’s store for what it will bring for cash in Quincy. I bought a white rubber coat for $2 cash.</span>

<strong>Tuesday 16</strong> - It still rained all night in the valley and the snow is being washed away some. The branch of the creek that runs through the yard is quite full to over flowing. Snow mixed with rain this morning as it fell. I bought six pairs of pants at $14, and seven pairs stocking at $2.50, and one other pair at $1. I then sold one pair at $2.50.

<strong>Wednesday 17</strong> - It continues to rain in the valley and snow on mountains.

<strong>Saturday 20</strong> - Some of my plank fence blew down last night in back of town. Still raining.

<strong>Sunday 21</strong> - Still raining. I’ve spent $.50 for billiards and $.50 for something else.

<strong>Monday 22</strong> - I cleared up this evening a dance at Betsy Town tonight The frogs has been singing in the valley since the middle of last week. It looks very much spring in valley.

<strong>Tuesday 23</strong> - A fine day. I took some pills this morning. I ate but little today: some tea and toast at supper. Carter got up with the mail. My wife received a letter from H. Rankin of Georgetown, Kentucky giving some information of hard times and scarcity of provisions and the necessity of doing something with our negroes in Kentucky.

<strong>Wednesday 24</strong> - It is a beautiful sunny day and the nights not very cold. The weather has all the appearance of spring. The frogs are singing in the evening and the hens cackling.
