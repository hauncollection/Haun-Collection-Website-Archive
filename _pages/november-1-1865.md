<p style="padding-left: 120px;">Thursday Nov 1st 1865</p>
Mr Haun
<div style="text-indent: 4em;">Dearest One</div>
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">As we are invited to</div>
attend the society tomorrow
night, and have a dress body to make to
morrow, to wear consequently will not
have any other time to write, to you
will embrace, the present optunity for
you say it is a pleasure you look
forward to, the reception of my letters
and I do not with to deprive you
of that pleasure, when avoidable. Yours
arived on Monday eve. but the tenor
of some parts is rather amusing
you pretend to be terably afraid of
Dick. well he sent a card on Friday
I did not receive him. sent one the
following saturday I then received
him he also made an engagement
for sunday and then I received a
letter which I did not answer. I
shall always be pleased to see him
but intend to cease the corespondence
And you think I am so fickle as
to change the love of One I think
would be constant truce and never
forsake for another untried. But
Dick is in the back ground while
Mr Woolman takes the lead
he is more devoted than the former
sent me the nicest bottle of wine
all fixed up in ribon, comes
twice a week, what do you think
of that. But I never could make
you jealous and I try so hard
thinking there is more love existing
when a little such feeling is deployed
Cousin F sends her kindest regards
and says she is watching the corners
for you. But I some times think
it would be better, as you say if
I should become enamoured else
whare. Those words, are words I never
liked coming from you, that perhaps
it were better if we had never met
when from lovers, I have always been
acustomed to having them sue, or
sigh for a love I never gave, it sounds
rather strange to me to hear one say
or seem as though it were a matter
to be rejects or not just as circumstances
will. I am rather high minded in
such matters you know full well
and perhaps, you may think from
the tone of this letter I am undergoing
a chance in sentiment whilst I
remain the same I have received
two letters from Dora this week in which
she has forwarded letters received for
me there. I am glad to hear that Joe &amp; Millie
N__ are fairly launched in matrimony &amp;
wish them a long and happy life. you
ask when I expect to return. I do not know
Couin Fannie is fusing because I told
her I intended to return home when Mr
King came. She wants me receive him
here but I prefer receiving my friends
in my own home. she has a great deal
to do, and says I have got to stay with
her till she gets through. I may and
then I may not just as the notion
takes me. We will always be pleased
to see you when ever you choose to
come. I seen Clifford this evening she
has been quite sick but is better at
present. I can scarcely write the children
are keeping such a noise. I hardely
know what I have written here but
you must puzzel it out
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">in haste, but</div>
none the less fondly
<p style="padding-left: 180px;">Mollie</p>
PS Write soon
Rube.
