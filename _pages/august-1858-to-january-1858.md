<h3>August</h3>
<strong>Sunday 1</strong> - Quincy is almost deserted. Times are hard and getting worse.

<strong>Monday 2</strong> - Thompson came down soon and closed the trade with John. He is to give up three of my notes and get 1/4 of the Massack ditch and tools also.

<strong>Tuesday 3</strong> - I and Henry shouldered our rifles and came to my old diggins. All is quiet and still. Henry made bread, then we had our dinner without meat. We then went down to the Point. I talked with Ray about the right he held to Smith’s interest in Nelson Creek. He let me see the bill of sale. We got some beef and came to the cabin and had supper.

<strong>Wednesday 4</strong> - I called to Henry to get up, as it was late. I slept well enough but was harassed by dreams about my business affairs. So, I was in a bad humor to wake up, having been troubled both wake and asleep.

Since the above date, it would be needless for me to attempt anything like a true statement of facts, though I will endeavor to state some of the most prominent events that has happened up to the present time.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I am now takings easy as to work, but I was never so hard up in business matters. Suffice to say I am willing to turn my attention to most anything for relief, for bankruptcy is staring me in the face sometime near the close of August.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Those that were called ‘Douglass Popular Sovereignty Democrats’ held a meeting in which I was nominated coroner. I had to make a small speech on the occasion. In a few days I went to Humbug Valley, stayed one night, then down to Rich Bar on the North Fork of the Feather River. I stayed one night there and the next day went home. At all events, the election came off first week in September and I was beaten, as I expected, by Dr. Cate, by over 200 votes.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">About the close of September I went down to Marysville to see if I could borrow some money, but I made very little exertion to get it. I done this for the purpose of getting some relief and out of the way of dunning creditors.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">H.P. was down to San Francisco on account of bad health, and his son also. They all came up at the close of the first week in October and stayed all night at Jack’s. Henry said I was a Republican. I said at home when the like was said I gave it the bye. I did not ask him to help me raise any money; neither did I go to see him. On the 10th of October I started for home--for the American Valley. I arrived the evening of the 11th, a Sunday at that.</span>

<strong>Monday 12</strong> - Our circuit court commenced. We had two cases in court. We got a judgement in one case against Jas Smith at Nelson Creek. He has no property to make the money out of. The other case was laid over ten days for time to answer. In that time the court adjourned.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I was somewhat unwell with chills. Overton came over. My wife and I made a deed to the ranch and took up our note and mortgage. We made every effort in our power to wind up. My wife in the meantime closed out at the tavern and we sold off most of our loose plunder. We got a horse and spring wagon to leave the valley in, which we done, but not until we had made some arrangements to get the ranch back. My wife paid $300 and left $150 for John to pay, which he did soon after we left.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">There had been a big fall of snow for the season, but we got out before any more fell and in November we were three days in getting down to Jack’s.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Soon after, I went up to Bourne’s to get money he owed. A few days after, he sent me $360 in two parcels. I sold the horse and wagon to Jack for $250. I then sent Overton $550 on November 22nd.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I put in my time helping Jack. I wrote three letters to John to come down and John wrote one to his Ma that he would wait until I came up. We get it about the 20th of January 1859. So, on Sunday morning at 6:00 I put out for the mountains, and that evening, I suppose, John arrived at Jack’s.</span></span>
<h3><strong>January</strong></h3>
<strong>Sunday 23</strong> - My passage up to New York House was $6. Then I footed it the rest of the way. Paid $1 for breakfast at Sabriskey’s. I took dinner as I traveled on foot. Often bread and chicken that Ellen had prepared for me. I arrived a few minuted after the saddle train had got in from the same place.

<strong>Monday 24</strong> - Lodging and whiskey at the Columbus House, $1. I supped on my bread and chicken and was off at daylight for Rabbit Creek. The road from here on was covered with snow and ice. I beat the train in by half an hour. I was at Rabbit Creek at half past 10:00 A.M. I took dinner on the road to Gibsonville off my bread and chicken and pound cake. I arrived at a quarter past 2:00 and put up for the rest of the day and night.

<strong>Tuesday 25</strong> - Supper, lodging and breakfast, $2.50. After sunrise I started for home against the heaviest wind that I’ve had to contend with in these mountains. I got the Nelson Creek before 1:00 P.M. I wasted an hour here, and also at Onion Valley and finished my provisions as I passed my old diggins. I got to Quincy before sunset and none to welcome me home. All desolate dreary. I took supper with Duesler and slept in my own bed all alone.

<strong>Wednesday 26</strong> - I breakfasted with Duesler and put in my time around town and again took supper at Duesler’s. I turned in at home for sleep. Our dog Gris was gone, but he came back when I called him by name. He seemed to be well acquainted. I fed him. A right big kitty came in, very glad to see me. I fed him also.

<strong>Thursday 27</strong> - I took breakfast with Truitt. I looked around home and cut some wood for my room stove. The white faced cow had a calf on the snow and we put them in the barn. I took supper with Duesler.

<strong>Friday 28</strong> - I was at Duesler’s for my breakfast again. I then bought some beef $1.75. I cleaned up the pantry, kitchen and dining room, cooking tools and dishes, and made some biscuits, the first I ever tried. I cooked some beef steak and made tea and ate supper at home.

<strong>Saturday 29</strong> - It snowed 6 in deep last night. I warmed up my steak, bread and tea and breakfasted. I paid $.50 for candles, $.75 for a bar of soap, $.50 for a box of blacking, and $.50 for two pieces of window glass. I put one in the pantry. I fixed the sink in kitchen.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I got $4 of Bates and Brooks for one day’s use of oxen and sledge. Preacher Grove paid me $21 for hay and pasturage, and $1.50 for a bale of hay. It has been snowing some all day. I did some sewing on my pants tonight. I wrote my wife a letter on Thursday evening, express $.25, and made this entry.</span>

<strong>Sunday 30</strong> - I was up before day and made some repairs to the kitchen. I was some time in getting the stove hot. I made up some dough and put it to baking enough biscuits to last another day, as I only take two meals per day. It snowed considerably last night. Its sloppy and the sun is shining. I put a pane of glass in the dinning room window. No one has been to see me yet.

<strong>Monday 31</strong> - Stormy again last night. I paid $1.25 for beef. I get a little wood to cook burn in the house.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I, with five other jurymen, decided the right of property. We received a fee of $3 each.</span>
