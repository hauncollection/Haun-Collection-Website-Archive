thankfull for the sake of his Parents

<p style="text-align: left;">January 7 1864</p>
Dear Friend
I enclose a letter which, was written to
Mrs Webb, by a friend of yours, conserning yourself
and parents. She sent for me yesterday morning
I went to see her and she wished to know if I
had heard from you lately, and handed me the
letter to read I told her it had been some time
but I was expecting a letter every day so she
said she would answer his letter, and enclose
your letter to her, in his and [illegible] you
had been heard from since and was well she
also sent your adress to him perhaps he will
write to you. And late in the evening I received
your letter, So I went directly to see her thinking
perhaps she had not started her letter, but she

[upside down]
you say you would give three brass
buttons to have a chat with one. Well I declare {Three
brass buttons the whole amount} And advese me
to marry a Widdower, Good advice. I always did
think you appreciated me very highly
now I know it. I dont think I coudl allow another
theft after that It looks like you think two much of
a feelow. But I must hush my fooishness by asking
you to make some allowances as this is Leap Year

[sideways]
and I have just set out. just take our advice and belive that

[other side]
creaspin in person to the ladder as you spoke of

had mailed it. She sent to Mr chambers
and got it, and had Birty to oepn it
and say {that a letter had been received since
the above was written from you that you were
well, and seemed to be very hopefull of getting
out} You say you like advice from a friend,
Mrs Webb, speaks very highly of you indeed, and
says she would talk to you and advise as her own son and
being a mother, she can feel for yours. She requests
me to send this letter to you, and to say to you
for her. For God sake to take the Oath come home and, go to
your mother. That you were not stout enough to
endure the hardships of a soldier, and not to
linger in prison for there is no telling when this
thing will end and not to distress your mother
if She had another child with her it would be
difrent. I told her I did not expect you would
take the call for fear of being branded as a Cuard
But she says if we stop for what the world
would say it would be a bad policy. That it
is a duty You owe to your mother. I think
Mrs Well is about corect in her advice,

[upside down]
come home Mike Barlow writes that he is a broken

[sideways]
down soldier and is coming home

excepting the going home part {Leap Year} dont
be suprised, I like Mrs Webb very much she seems
so motherly in her disposition. When I start home
it was almost dark and very slipery nothing would
do her but she must send some one home with me
I thanked her and told her I was not afraid
but child she sais I am afraid for you
you might fall and hurt yourself. Now if
you had been here I might have
let you come home with me for it is very
sliperry. There is a deep snow on the ground
which has lain for a week or more, it is now
snowing very fast. We have had the coldest
weather ever known in Ky. John Mrs Webb asked
me some very funny questions and when I
would answer her she would look at me as
strange as much to say I dont believe you
But I am a truthful Young Ladie aint I You
can testify to that cant you. I was wondering
if you did not suffer this cold weather with
cold. I am sitting by a good warm fire and
hope you are as comfortably situated as myself

[upside down] Jim Beatty Sam Johnnie has take the Oath and

Ma has just made some hot mince pies I wish
I could send you some in this letter. You ask me
if I had seen or heard from your letter to
a ladie friend I read the first but not the last
I am at a loss to know what you mean in
regard to George Jackson, he never waited on me
in his life I would prefer some one a little more
intelectual, not saing but what he is a very diserving
young man, but I know nothing about him. Mr Jerrie
Stevens has come back to live. Mrs Dorsey is dead
I attended her funerall and John Warrens, yesterday
his body arived on monday Mrs Tom Johnson
lost a little girl christmas week. Poor Sallie she seemes
to take the death of her granma very hard and I fear
it will not be long before she will have to give up
her husband and then she will be entirely alone. But
I must tell you something about our fair. We cleared about
one hundred and twenty dolars Gabe andI took in at
our table the first night 21 dolars 30 cts, Gabe being sick
the last night I took in about 23 dollars 50 cts. George
Fitzgerald and I aranged the cedars around the room
while the others died it. We were complemented very highly
on our good taste. We had quite a fine time. Most
all the boys have been trying to kill them selves getting
drunk this christmas. But for want of space I must
close as you have your friends A dress you had better
write to him {I think if you were to treat a Wife as you
have your mother you would make some poor

[sideways]
broken hearted creature a good husband. Write just as soon as

[upside down]
you get this while I remain your friend Molie B

Gabbie and Billie are more desperat than ever
