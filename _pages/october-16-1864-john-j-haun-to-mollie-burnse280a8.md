Dear Friend,

Mary, your welcome letter of the 6th[note]This letter has been preserved and is available <a title="October 6 1864" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/version-iii-series-ii/october-6-1864-mollie-burns-to-john-j-haun%E2%80%A8/">here</a>.[/note] was received on the 12th but I was unable to answer sooner, being allowed to write but two letters a week. A note was enclosed from Mrs Webb to you giving me the information I desired. I also received a letter yesterday from Mrs Webb.

Ruby, you are such a hand to joke. You must not try to make me believe you would not write to anyone else because you feel so unwell—but it is all right, I will not dispute your word this time. I am glad to inform you I am not deprived of my health, if I am of my liberty and a great many of the comforts of life. Ruby, I think you have slighted me somewhat by being so close and not coming to see a body. I am sure I would have called on you had I been that near you.

Enclosed you will find a ring of my own manufacture, thinking probably you would fancy it. If you wish a smaller or larger one tell me in your next and I will send it immediately. It represents sun in the center and small branches on each side in gold and silver. Is Dora at home now? Tell me when you write again.

I think you are worth a dozen other girls now, but if you will send me that pretty picture right soon I will think you worth two dozen. It seems as if you were trying yourself just to see how much you can fly around of late. That is right, take all the pleasure you can while it is going. I think I will pay up for lost time if I ever get out—but I expect to spend another winter in Camp Chase first. Just to think: fifteen months in prison. Too bad, is it not?

I must close for want of space. Please answer this soon. Your letters give me more news than any others. I shall not forget Mary.

As ever your sincere friend,

J.J.H.
