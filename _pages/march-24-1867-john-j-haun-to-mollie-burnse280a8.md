<span style="margin-left: 430px;">Sunday March 24th 1867</span>

My own Dear Mollie,

This is a beautiful day and my thoughts are of you. Consequently I feel very much like talking to you, even if it is on paper. Oh how I would like to spend this sabbath evening in your company and listen to that voice and steal a glance at that bright sunny face of yours. Then the evening would glide away pleasantly to me. Perhaps you think I am going into conniptions over your charms, but I cannot express the half I feel for you, love.

I went to the reform church this morning and listened to Mr McGinn but it is such a pretty day I can hardly stay in the house. We have one case of small pox in town, or rather it has been moved out near Degarn’s mill last night. Mrs Jenkins said she got a letter from you and that you did not get the card I threw over until after I passed in my way home. I saw cousin Fannie at the window as I passed home but didn’t think I saw you. You were not up when I passed in the morning but I saw someone open the back door and look out through it--was it you or the house maid, love?

I did not think I would go Tuesday when I was over or I would have told you Dora will commence school in Edmenson’s house tomorrow morning. I set down the school desks for her. I have been to your house very often lately, Dora says, much oftener than when you were at home but I naturally love the place and its inmates. I had quite a game of marbles with Boots and Jim.

Bob Small has joined the Baptist Church at last and is the best man in the world. I am going down to see Mrs J. and swap a few lies with her and then I will finish my letter. The students are all farming and going up to be prayed for, girls and all. They will get a good harvest I expect, this time.

Well, I have seen Mrs Jenkins. She says she will not write to you tomorrow for you will be so glad to get my letter you will perhaps be unnoticed. I told her you was not that sort of lady, but she says she had sweethearts when she was young and knows how they do. So I suppose you will be home this week? Well I will be very glad, for you don’t know how much I want to see you. I am afraid you will sit too close to that doctor over there. I have spies to take items for me over there, so mind how you cut your capers while away.

Elgin Tom Barkley and myself took a walk out to Dick Thomkin’s this evening, and sat about an hour with him and old Frank Dayne. The Negroes had a baptizing this evening; they baptized about thirteen or fourteen. One woman got to shouting in the water and kicked very high for a girl and a man got happy also, so you see the town is growing decidedly better fast, love.

I don’t know of anything new to write you. This is the first pretty day we’ve had for a long time. I went up to see Dora about Church time but she had company from the country. She had been to Mr Moore’s and had just got home. I must bring this to a close as I shall retire early tonight. Write to me the last of the week if you do not come home, but I would rather see you in person. So goodbye you darling, sweet, lovely angel, till I see you. As ever your own devoted until death...

P.S. Please excuse the envelope.

- Hubby
