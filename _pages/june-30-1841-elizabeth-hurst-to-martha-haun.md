Dear Sister,

I must confess I have postponed writing to you too long—but it was owing to my being so busy fixing for housekeeping—that was the cause of it. I was married the 3rd of this month and moved the 8th to my new home.

I suppose Henry has written to you all about the wedding, as he promised me he would the morning after. Patsy, there were very few at the wedding. There was Henry and his sister, Mr. Bryans’ family, Mr. Offertt’s, and Mrs. Cassell’s, and a few other strangers. That was all, except the relations.

I’m like to forget to tell you how all were—they are all well, so far as I know.

Jincy and little John come home with me when I moved and stayed a few days with me. John got very lonesome and said everything he could think of to get to go home, but could get no company to go home with him. At last John said to me one day, “Aunt Lizzy, I am not a going to stay here no longer, to be starving every day." Says I, “John, I thought I was giving you everything that was good: strawberries, raspberries, ripe apples, and everything—and now you are going to tell them all I am starving you?” No, he says, he wont tell nobody I was starving him, he’d just got tired.

I asked him what I must write to his Ma and Pa for him, and he said, “Write to Ma and Pa I have come up here and raised bigger corn than grandma or uncle Jimmy. He has his corn in the garden and plows it every Saturday. He makes Nat pull the plow and he holds it, and that is the way he plows.

Patsy, Brother James was here yesterday and told me Sister Lydia and Perry was in from the Missouri. They are staying at Mother’s and have been there since last Thursday. I have not seen them yet, nor am I in a hurry to see them, as I expect they have come to make another disturbance in the settlement.[note]Monetary arrangement[/note] James Nutter told Mr. Moore last Saturday that he had torn up the first settlement agreement and was going to make Brother Jimmy make another, with a difference of one hundred dollars apiece.

I have not seen Jim Nutter since I was married, nor do I want to see him. He was not at the wedding at all, but if ever I do see him I well tell him I want none of his news or his company about me at all. I see he is about doing with me as he did with you after you married, Patsy.

I have never been to see any of them since I was married nor do I ever expect to go often. I have been to Mother’s every week and I intend to do so as long as she lives, and I live near her. She looks so desolate and lonely when I go there—no person there but her and Jincy—that it makes my heart ache to look at her. She has a long cry every time I go, about her situation, and none of her children with her. She says you must came and stay with her, Patsy, as long as she lives, as you are all the child that can come to live with her—and she will do everything she can for you. Patsy, do come up and stay this summer, if you can’t stay no longer. Be certain to come.

I got a letter from John yesterday. They were all well and Bud can begin to walk a little. Sally Ann Wallace has got a fine daughter, I am told, but I have not seen it yet. Martha says it is exactly like Dick.

Patsy, Drake was married, the next Sunday morning after I was to Miss Rebecca Cromwell, daughter of Mr. Vincent Cromwell. He has been to see me and stayed all night.

I must come to a close now, as Mr. Moore is in a hurry to start to town. Patsy, I feel like I could write a day longer if I had time, but must close. Give my love to Mr. Haun and tell him I would like very much to see him, and that he must come and see me and my old bachelor as soon as he can at home, and see how we look now. And tell Bet I reckon she can marry now, as I am married.

So goodbye,

Elizabeth C Hurst                                           Martha Haun

P.S. Mother and Jincy send there love to you all. Jincy says you must give her best respects to Mrs Bedford and family also to Mrs Selby and family.
