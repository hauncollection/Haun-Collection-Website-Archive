<span style="margin-left: 460px;">Georgetown
<span style="margin-left: 460px;">October 25, 1854[note]James Haun recorded the receipt of this letter in his diary on <a title="December 1854" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/version-iii-series-i/december-1854/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 4 1854</a>.[/note]</span></span>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dear Uncle,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have not written to you for several weeks so I thought I would do it now. I have prepared all of my lessons for the afternoon and I thought I would take this half hour to write to you and cousin.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Aunty received a letter from you not long since (perhaps last week). She answered it that night and I put a little scribbling in it just to be communicating to you. We have never received a letter from Pa since he left here last fall. I wrote him a letter a few weeks ago and I am in hopes he will answer it. I am still going to school, to Mr Hand.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I heard that Martha Lowards was to be married tonight but I cant tell how true it is.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Oh Uncle, you can't imagine how much I want to see you and John. I long for the time to come. I would like to hear in the next letter that you intend to come home in the spring for I know you cant come home this fall or winter. Please write to us in the next letter that you are coming in the spring (that is if you can).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Our town is very dull so I have nothing to write that would interest you. I must bring my short letter to a close. Give my best love to John and tell him I think he might answer my letters. I remain your affectionate daughter.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Write soon,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lizzie Hurst</span></p>
