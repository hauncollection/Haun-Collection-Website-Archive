My Dear Husband,

I sat down this Sunday night after coming from church to commence a letter to you. I do not expect to finish it tonight.

We are all in good health at this time. Betty has not been confined yet. I am almost out of patience waiting on her. The connections and friends are all well and all of the Negroes.

I will try and give you an account of the proceedings of the church in B.W. Finnell and Shepard’s trial. You know they had appointed a committee of ten to investigate and settle the difficulty. They were nearly three days investigating the matter and making out a report. After the congregation was dismissed last Sunday he requested the members to remain. He then asked if the report should be read. The committee said yes, and their report was that Shepard had acted in a way calculated to deceive Finnell. Shepard told Finnell that he would see him at 4 o’clock in the evening to let him have a negro man and some land on Eagle to pay the debt he owed him. Within an hour after telling F. that, he went to Howard, Smith and Robinson and made a deed of trust and put all of his property out of his hands. Shepard acknowledged to the committee that he had no intention of doing what he told F. he would do, but told him this to get clear of him. Of course the committee condemned that in him.

After brother Smith read the report on Sunday last, Shepard seemed to be very angry and said the report was false and said a great many things to hurt the feelings of the committee and brother Smith also; he was very severe on him. They did not put it to vote that day whether or not the church would receive the report of the committee, but appointed last Friday to settle it.

The members were all there and Jeffy got up and laid the whole matter before the church: all the business transactions of his and Finell’s. The church then voted and received the report, then Jeffy got very angry and withdrew him and his wife from the church. I do not think there was three members on his side. It is my opinion, with some others, that he was determined that the fuss between him and F. should get him out,  for he knew if that had been settled amicably the matter of his child would have been brought up next, and I think he could not stand that. Jeff had B.J.Thompson, D.H. Smith and B. Glass’ testimony taken in the church, but it would not all do him any good. He is now out of the church --

My dear, I resume my writing again tonight.

Yesterday Mrs Holtzclaw and Betty and Betty Moorland and Mrs Keene and myself spent the day at Ben Rinnell’s. Tomorrow we are all going to sister Johnson’s in the country. Sister Johnson told me to say to you for her that she comes to see me every few days and sends her love to you. She comes two or three times a week. I never can forget her kindness to me. In fact, everyone seems very kind to me. I never sit two hours alone. Every one of the ladies in the house flock to my room, and there is every day more or less calls on me. Mrs Powell is very friendly. Though I do say it myself, I know that my society is as much or more courted than any lady in this place, and then they show a disposition to try and make me pass of  my time pleasantly. Dr Keene is so thoughtful and kind to me. I pass my time as pleasantly as I could possibly do under the circumstances, but, oh, away from all that is dear to me on earth--how could I expect much happiness?

But when intelligent men, men whose opinion is worth hearing speak of our fortitude, and say you have taken the proper course, and the wise one for the benefit of our child, and speak in such high terms of your energy and determination, I feel as though I could bear it with all fortitude.

General Johnson come to see me and said he was glad that you had done what you have, that it was the very best thing you could have done. He said he knew you was too good a business man to be wasting your time here. He says he knows you will make money. He urged me to go about among my friends and  spend my time cheerfully and pleasantly.

Emma Smith told me to say to you to make the acquaintance of the young gentleman she sent the letter to by you. She said she wrote to him about you, telling him to do the same. Mrs Holtzclaw says you must be sure to write as she told you she sends her best respects to you. There is so many persons making inquiries about you and saying, “give him my love when you write,” that I could not begin to name them. It is almost everyone in town. Even old Dr Sutton every time he sees me is asking about you. Martha Graves sends her love to you and says she misses you very much at church and you must make haste and come back. She says, “tell him I hope the Lord will prosper him, and every one that you ever had any intimacy with.”

I ride almost as much as I did when I had a buggy. Dr Keene bought a gentle horse on purpose for his wife to drive, and her and I ride often. Bet Mooreland says I must ride with her this summer, so between the two I expect to ride a great deal.

Well we spent the day today with sister Johnson and I will give you the names of the ladies that went from town: Mrs Saunders, Mrs Bradly, Mr Holtzclaw, Mrs Duvall, Mrs Martha Graves, Mrs Hull, and Mrs Keene, Bet Mooreland, Bet Holtzclaw, Gabe Saunders, Mrs Cable and myself. We had quite a pleasant time but, oh, when I sat down to the table at dinner, spread so bountifully with the luxuries of life I thought “now maybe my poor dear husband and child are in want of even the necessaries of...”
