<strong>Monday 1</strong> - Before day. The snow is falling in large lumps off the trees onto my cabin roof, and making the boards fairly crack. It is raining again and wind blowing and trees falling. After Breakfast there was thunder and lightning.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I started John and Charles up the ditch. They found three large trees had fallen across the ditch and the brush had stopped the water some. When opened, it came down with a rush. I and Lawrance went out to the diggins. While out there it changed to snowing again and continued all day. After dinner John went up the ditch to cut some limbs out of the way. I and Lawrence went out to the diggins to see after the water, but it had decreased very much. We went up the ditch and found the snow had choked it up. We threw it out again, &amp;c.</span>

<strong>Tuesday 2</strong> - The snow 1 foot deep. The four of us cut down a large pitch pine. By noon we had the limbs about our cabins. In the afternoon I, John and Charles cleaned up our boxes and got gold $28, and set them over again. Lawrence and Lloyd cleaned up theirs. Cloudy somewhat, and inclined to storm. Our neighbors, Hardin and company, have been compelled to stop mining. The water is needed on the other side of creek, says Clark.

<strong>Wednesday 3</strong> - Snowed last night and all day. It is between 1 1/2 and 2 feet deep at our cabins. We did not attempt to work. Four of us went down to the Point. All the ditches and flumes is snowed out as well as us. Lloyd stayed at home. John got a new hat for $4. It was still snowing moderately at my late bedtime.

<strong>Thursday 4</strong> - Still snowing and was at it all night and all of today. Quite a late bedtime. The moon is shining out bright. All five of us went up the ditch to see after the water, but it was nearly all taken up in the snow--so much so that it did not show itself 50 yards from the head of the ditch. We could do nothing with it. We turned about and came home. The snow is between two and three feet deep and hard to get through.

<strong>Friday 5 </strong>- Somewhat cloudy and snowing at intervals today. We all went down to the Point except John. I and John fixed a tongue in our slide, ready for carting ---

<strong>Saturday 6</strong> - Clear and cold this morning. The sun shone bright all day and the sky never seemed to be bluer. I and John were shoveling the snow away from the door and cutting some wood that had been covered up. Lloyd went down to the Point. He came home after dinner.

<strong>Sunday 7</strong> - Cold this morning, but it clouded up and continued more or less so all day, though it got warm enough to soften the snow a little. I wrote a letter H.P. and one to Dave.

<strong>Monday 8</strong> - Rained a very little all day. Lloyd went down to the Point.

P.M. The express had got in no letters. He brought up the New York Herald of December 5 1854 that had the President’s message. We did not work. My lesson was the 21st Chapter Luke.

<strong>Tuesday 9</strong> - Warm all day with some sunshine, but most of it was cloudy and quite foggy. This morning four of us went up the ditch and cleaned out the snow where it was not covered with brush. We got the water running down to where it is covered.

<strong>Wednesday 10</strong> - Clear and warm. Having had fire day and night, the rocks got so hot that they set logs outside the fireplace afire yesterday. I did not get it out, so this morning I and John took out one log and built the fireplace up with rocks. John sent a letter to his ma, and I one to Dave and to H.P.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We went up the ditch this evening. The water is nearly down to the reservoir. The snow has settled down very much.</span>

<strong>Friday 11</strong> - Shaw came home last night. The weather is warm and pleasant. The snow melted off the trees, making it so heavy on the ditch that some of the cross timbers broke in two and dropped the covering down into the ditch. The five of us hoisted it up and put in new timbers today. We’re not yet done.

<strong>Friday 12</strong> - All five are at work putting new timbers to hold up the brushworks on the ditch. We made a finish. The sun shines pleasantly.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We set the trap last evening. Today we took out another kangaroo or something else of the kind, I know not. But we have him chained to a  block between our cabins.</span>

<strong>Saturday 13</strong> - Cool nights and pleasant days. We was all getting wood  till noon. In the afternoon we were idling our time away. The animal slipped its halter last night.

<strong>Sunday 14</strong> - Fine pleasant weather. Nights are cool, and the snow melts but little. I went down to the Point, but no letters. My lesson is the 10th Chapter of John.

<strong>Monday 15</strong> - We had a general settlement. I then went down to the Point and loaned two of the Shultses $175 for five months. I am to have $10 per month for the use of the money, with good security. Lloyd paid me $155 for the use of one of my interests from 21 June last to 1 January 1855. The nights are cool and the days pleasant. I paid $11 for the company and $1.75 for ourselves for small items.

<strong>Tuesday 16</strong> - We all five of us concluded to  get up some lumber for sluice boxes. John went and got a whipsaw. By that time, the rest of us had a log cut, hewn, and laid upon the pit ready for sawing. But it was work none of us had done, so we all tried but I and Lawrance could saw the best.

P.M. I sent John down to the Point after a file to whet the saw, cost $1 per comb.

<strong>Wednesday 17</strong> - I whetted the saw and we went to it, but my arms is very sore. We have made four planks in two days of sawing. The weather it still delightful. Lloyd and Shaw went down to the Point after another saw but got none. Lloyd stayed all day and came home after night somewhat drunk.

<strong>Thursday 18 </strong>- Somewhat cloudy and wind was blowing, indicating falling weather. We all had a good time, making our arms sore from working Bray’s whipsaw.

<strong>Friday 19 </strong>- Cold last night and clear. Somewhat windy and cool today as well. We finished sawing one log in the morning. In the afternoon three of us cut and hewed another and put it on the pit and pined it. We moved the pit near the log, &amp;c. I had a late bedtime. Its snowing.
<strong>
Saturday 20</strong> - There is but little new falling snow this morning. Cold and clear. I, John and Shaw did some sawing today. We got along quite well. Lloyd started for Marysville, so say the boys. Lawrance set in the cabin nearly all day. Its a fine day for sliding down the hill, as the snow has a crust and will bare a man. Warm and pleasant all day.

<strong>Sunday 21 </strong>- Last night I washed myself all over. I washed a pair of socks and a towel and put on a clean shirt, the first for three weeks. I had John trim my hair. After dinner I went down to the Point. The express had got in, but no letters. Several men were drunk and more gambling. I came home to eat supper and read the 5th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles. I was up two or three times in the night, when cold. I built a good fire and lay down again.

<strong>Monday 22</strong> - It was somewhat cloudy yesterday and cold at night. I was up before day.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I dreamed my wife and I was coming to California. I thought we were on a steamer not far from the isthmus. Several times I thought I was traveling in that way and it appeared I was in great danger of being drowned.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Shaw and Lawrance went out to hew a log to saw into planks. John and Allen went to sawing. I went down to the Point stayed all day. I got another whipsaw. Everett came in, but no letters.</span>

<strong>Tuesday 23</strong> - I dreamed last night that I was at the old mill and my mother was living. I thought she said that my wife was overbearing, and told how I thought that we would not be long with her, that we were going to California, soon. I thought my wife came in just then.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">It was warm and pleasant today. The boys went 1/2 mile, put a log on the slide, and hauled it down to our cabins to saw into planks. It is 14 feet long, 16 by 12 inches. We are four cuts from having it sawed.</span>

<strong>Wednesday 24</strong> - It was warm and somewhat cloudy all day. We finished the 3rd and got the 4th nearly done.

P.M. John, Shaw and Charles was setting the penstock anew. We will have sawed 834 feet of plank in all when we finish the four pieces---

<strong>Thursday 25</strong> - Last night, when all were asleep but me there appeared distant thunder. Soon the cabin shook, the boards cracked. An earth quake. Its over now. We hewed out two small sticks to make false bottoms sawed one into slats 2 by 2 1/2 inches broad and 7/8 of an inch in thickness. The other is to be same. It is warm and pleasant. The ground begins to show itself in places.

<strong>Friday 26</strong> - We finished sawing the slate for false bottoms, and there's nothing more to do. The weather is pleasant enough but we can’t mine for the want of water, &amp;c ---

<strong>Saturday 27</strong> - The weather is so pleasant. The sun shined out warm, so much so that the green flies were flying about. We did no work. I packed up some wood in the A.M.

P.M. I went down to the Point and took Sterling’s saw home. I got 23 pounds beef, cost $4.50.

<strong>Sunday 28</strong> - Up before day and read the from the first to the tenth chapter of First Corinthians. After breakfast I went down to the Point. The rest of the boys came down, but I did not see them.

P.M. I went down on Columbia Flat and stopped at Dover’s awhile and then to Bass’ till sunset. I got acquainted with Mrs and Miss Bass. Stephen Bass wants to sell out his diggins.

<strong>Monday 29</strong> - I and John concluded to hew a log. It was after noon before we got it ready to haul down to the pit near the cabin. It was quite as much as we could do.We lined it up all ready for sawing tomorrow.

<strong>Tuesday 30</strong> - I dreamed last night that some man, hearing my name mentioned, said that he would make me a present of the finest coat that could be had in Georgetown. I thought that Tyson Bell made it, and old Rankin sold the goods. It cost $489.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I and John was at work soon whipsawing by 1/2 past 10 A.M. We had finished the log off into 120 inch plank. I cut some dry wood before dinner, and then went down to the Point after dinner. No Eastern mail has come in.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I could but stand and gaze at two men, sledding down the hill on a door to the foot of bridge, one of them a man of 40 years old with a wife at San Francisco and a good friend to me --- but whiskey does its work for many.</span>

<strong>Wednesday 31</strong> - Quite warm and cloudy. It sprinkled a few drops this morning, but cleared off. John bought an ax of Shaw for $1.75. A piece broke out of the edge. We took it and mine down to the Point and ground them sharp. I got a handsaw file at $.50 and John a pair of pantaloons, cost $5. No letters for me. Something is wrong ---
