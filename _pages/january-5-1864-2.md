Sabbath morning Jan 5th / 64

Mr Haun
Your very welcome letter came safely to hand last
Thursday eve but as I was preparing to make a short visit was unable
to answer it then But will do so now with pleasure. I am very
sorry you have been troubled on account of my ring I can
asure you its the ring you designed for one, containing glad
sun and silver leaves. I should have mentioned his before. I am
now visiting a brother near a small village by the name of Chandle
ville and nine miles out from the city of Barisville And this
is the holy Sabbath and I am devoting its sacred hours in writing
to you I have been so teazed by a little pet niece of mine following
me from room to room asking me about every five minutes if I
don’t like her better than her little sister Clare that I have been
compelled to retreat to the woods I only wish you could see and
enjoy the place as I do. I have heard of its beauty before but could not
imagine any place as beautiful and romantic Some would
call it a hill but I will call it a young mountain almost 4 miles in
length with a road gradually ascending to the top or a path just wide enough to receive a carriage at
either end and the lip as [illegible] covered with anus and wild flowers
and trees tops and with wild grape vines and rocks allmost hidden from sight
by vines and vines. I am going to press some of the flowers and send to
you. Jen will are doubt think I am growing very poetical and rosantie
but you can appreciate such places as I do and I allmost know you
do you will not blame me. I am allmost sure if you was here at this
moment you would admire the place with me. So you imagine
my rings are tokens from near and dear friends. I know we are apt
to judge other by ansdns “ present company excepted” I will not
deny that Bill G was a valued friend and as for any other friend I resp
ct him very much but think he is quite as dear to my particular
myself he has one year and three months yet to put in and will
perhaps return. Did you ever through sympathy and persuasions
of friend to anything you might forever regret. [illegible] have I been writing it know you will think me dishonorable with
them to a stranger, perhaps its the effect of my mail this somewhat
lonely place, and just when the full heart feels what at most
would forget But enough of this or you will begin to think I am really
sad I am not naturally so I assure you. you are a very [illegible] me to
the stamps I gave you and must have thought it a very good hint
continue the correspondence as you said you wished if agreeable to me
to continue it. It is [illegible] ly agreeable [illegible] I shall only regret
if our corespondence ever sesed as I expect to live an old maid
but fear some sore else will interpose with  you writing very well
an give up to any one who has a better claim on your attention than

[upside down]
Excuse this pencil have in good pen

meet and saying things that would give me just cause to blush
at should I live to be a matron of 45 and should I ever have the pla
sure of meeting you. I will no doubt listen  with pleasure and in
terst to your part and regret history fore I knew there would be much to in
terst me in one who has traveled so much and past
through so many exciting scenes as you must have done. I will
send you books this week have been disappointed about getting
them yesterday. But you have aroused my curiosity and dont think I
can wait so long for your story. Do you remember of you stopped a tour
house as you pased, me as a two story shity frame with a small yard in front and stones all around
and steps with a gate fronting the road, just two miles from [illedgible]
we had some choice flowers, rose bushes hanging over the walk and as their
homes was destroying them I kindly ask them to pleasant let them
pones eat them saken  each one politely took them away. I did not ex
pect that but was very grateful for it have wondered of any friend was
one of the member remembering you kindly I will remain
your friend

Nanie M McClelland
