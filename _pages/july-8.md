My Dear Sister,

I have not yet discovered a remedy for procrastination but have to regret the loss of valuable time continually the more as I grow older. You see from the number at the head of this paper, that we have changed our residence. The room we have now is far better than those we left, more airy and pleasant. The lady we rent of is a young married woman and is very agreeable. Her and her husband has gone to the country for a few days.

Now wonâ€™t you be surprised to hear that Mary was in Saratoga the last we heard from her. She sewed for a lady who boarded at the Galt house who took a great liking to Mary. She told her she was going to travel, and asked Mary to go with her. She said she would pay all traveling expenses and give her $1.50 per week extra if she would go. The lady has a granddaughter who goes with them. She has been a citizen of Louisville for 40 years and hardly knows how rich she is, so say persons that have known her. She is Episcopalian. They intend visiting Niagara Falls, New York City, Long Branch, Point Comfort. Mary saw Sis Miller in Cincinnati. All was well. They stopped at the Grand Hotel in Cincinnati got same attention as the lady herself. They expect to be gone 3 months.

The weather has been excessively warm though the mornings are cold. I received a letter yesterday from Mary Chalk. All is well. She expects to go to the sea shore and will start tomorrow. They are all going to the campground. She wrote that her school was out she passed her examination with honors.
