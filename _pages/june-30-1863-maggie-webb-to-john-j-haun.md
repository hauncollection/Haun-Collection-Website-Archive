John J. Haun Esq.,

Dear Sir,

Yours has just been received. I am sorry my arrangement did not suit you. You did not say you wanted the gold, and knowing I could sell it to better advantage here then in the country I did so, having no idea but that you wanted the funds for immediate use. Send me back the draft having first endorsed it to me and I will forward the gold forthwith.

I presume however you can without difficulty change the green backs to gold where you are, in which case it will be better for your to do so than to have it sent by express.

Respectfully,

Maggie K. Webb

Write me however you may decide about it.
