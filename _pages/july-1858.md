<strong>Thursday 1</strong> - Jake is still unwell. I went to work by myself till noon. In the P.M. John Vigris and I put ourselves through and cleaned up. Not much gold. This is not a good place.

<strong>Friday 2</strong> - All three pitched in and we moved up into Lloyd’s ravine. We set two boxes, turned in the water, and set in. Later we cleaned up, but no gold. The gold has left these parts. I don’t know where to try my luck again. It wont do.

<strong>Saturday 3 </strong>- Jake is not well, so I and John went out to clean up the bedrock. When it was time for a late dinner we had finished and got some gold. Jake had dinner ready. It over, I prepared to go over to the valley, and Jake down to the Point, and John was to stay till we got back. I gave Jake all the dust to pay off the accounts. John went a  short distance with me. We got home in good time.

<strong>Sunday 4</strong> - I put in my time as most men do in Quincy, going from one drinking house to another.

<strong>Monday 5</strong> - Today there has been a celebration for the fourth with a military parade and speeches to suit the occasion, and a dance tonight, given by Maston, in the courthouse.

<strong>Tuesday 6</strong> - The races commenced today: five entered. Stinson’s Woodpecker won the purse.

<strong>Wednesday 7</strong> - The same horse won the race today. I was not out on the hack today, but was yesterday.

<strong>Thursday 8</strong> - Five horses started today. Wheeler’s pride mare won the  race. I and my wife was out today.

<strong>Friday 9</strong> - I am not able to say at this time what was done, or what I did--but I’m sure nothing of importance. Times are going much worse with me all the time.

<strong>Saturday 10</strong> - I’ve had Smith sued and attached on the 6 instant if I made a mistake not, the time is waring a way very heavily, as money is very scarce with me and debts pressing.

<strong>Sunday 11</strong> - Nothing to do but to saunter around all day and witness all sorts of drunkards.

<strong>Monday 12</strong> - The district judge is on the bench, sexton I mean. I was summoned as a juror to attend tomorrow at 9:00 A.M.

<strong>Tuesday 13</strong> - I hired Joe Gass to help cut wheat. We commenced today. I am still a juror, but no case was tried by jurymen.

<strong>Wednesday 14</strong> - I have previously sent by Asheim $100 to John Overton at Onion Valley. I’m still a juryman, but no case was tried by jurymen.

<strong>Thursday 15</strong> - No change for the better. Still juryman, and discharged today without trying a single case.

<strong>Friday 16 </strong>- I am waiting to see if something won’t turn up to favor me. I can’t pay what I owe. The way I am progressing, who can help it?

<strong>Saturday 17</strong> - Nothing encouraging is to be seen for me. I will have to sell out before a great while.

<strong>Sunday 18</strong> - Some of the citizens, and I among the rest, went to hear preaching in the courthouse. This is the second time since I’ve been in California that the hat was handed round and I pitched in a quarter, giving to the poor and lending to the Lord.

<strong>Sunday 25</strong> - This week has passed off, how I can’t tell. My wife had a dance on the night of the 20th, so the week passed off up to Saturday the 24th, when all the ladies and gentlemen had a picnic up at Bates’ mill. All passed off well. Lloyd was shot twice in one leg this week by Dover at Nelson Point.

<strong>Monday 26</strong> - The case against Smith was tried before Hogan to quash the attachment, but before this another was heard, and our decision was delayed until the morning.

<strong>Tuesday 27</strong> - The judge decided against me and the attachment. So, I started for the diggins once more. I arrived at the cabin but no one was there. I took some hard bread, butter and molasses for dinner and wet down to the Point and then down to Rocky Bar to see Kyler.

<strong>Wednesday 28</strong> - I had a hard sleep of it last night. After breakfast I and Kyler went down the river to see some ground but pronounced it not good for money and left.

<strong>Thursday 29</strong> - I stayed to see Kyler burst his last rock on Rocky Bar, which he did in good style. Then, we went up to the Point. John came over on business with me, to know if he must sell the Mountain Comp’s ditch. I am too far, or too slow. It was Friday.

<strong>Friday 30</strong> - We both took dinner at Fox’s, cost us $3. We then went up to the diggins, and Jake also, to gather up the tools. That done, I and John started for valley.

<strong>Saturday 31</strong> - John Thompson came to ask John if he could get the ditch. A trade was conditionally made. He is to be back on Monday next.
