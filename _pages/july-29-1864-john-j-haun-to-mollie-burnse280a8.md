My dear friend,

According to your request I seat myself for the purpose of answering your letter of the 21st[note]This letter has been preserved, and is available <a title="July 21 1864" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/version-iii-series-ii/10809-2/">here</a>.[/note] which came to hand yesterday evening. So you see I am ever willing to do your bidding. “Good boy am I not?”

I hardly know how to commence to write an answer to your long letter. I can assure you it was welcomed with joy. I have not got entirely over the affects it produced yet, but I see something in it that causes me to put on my studying cap. I also see things I never found you guilty of before but they are not very serious offenses. That is a little flattery when you talk of showing one’s pretty face in Georgetown. However I will forgive you, if you will promise not to do so again—“will you?” Mary, won’t you allow a fellow to joke you a little sometimes about your badness. I go by contraries: when I say bad I mean good. You will please take it that way in future, don’t forget.

Mollie I am very sorry you think I do not pity you when others are so ready to censure you. You know but little of me if you think for one moment I would desert a friend in adversity; that is foreign to my nature. Do not put yourself to unnecessary trouble to ascertain the weight of the girls, as the original suits me much better than any other, for I know she is plump pretty and very neat with all.

Mary do you think I would go to California without calling to see you if I could prevent it? I do not know what course I will pursue when I get out. I’ve not even told my parents, but would willingly tell you, if I knew myself.

I cannot imagine what it is that is going to happen concerning yourself, unless it is your wedding. Is it or not? If so I should like to have an invitation to see it. I must close. My next letter will be a continuation of this one as I cannot say all I would like in this. Ruby, I have but little hope of getting to Kentucky soon. If I get out soon I will write you a long letter. Write very soon. Accept my best wishes for your future welfare, you sour girl.

Goodbye, while I ever remain your worst enemy,

J.J.H.

Jimmie Crumbaugh sent me a suit of clothes after [illegible]

I shall return in my way when I come home. Where there is so much sweet I should not be afraid to disclose I’ve a sore mouth too? it is from a sympathy for your I suppose.
