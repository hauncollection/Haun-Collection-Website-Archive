Miss Mollie, my friend,

Yours of the 28th of November has been received and duly considered and in return I am glad you are still good health and enjoying yourself so finely. You will no doubt think such a delay in answering your letter is a little strange. One reason is I did not have the ring completed and another is I have been a little unwell for several days--but nothing very serious, but am all right again. I only wish I could make a party of two to have some fun with you as I used to, but it looks like I never will cease to be an inmate of Camp Chase but, as the old maid said of marrying, as long as life lasts there is hope... (No allusion whatever.)

I think my time will not be more than four years longer at any rate. I am sorry for you. I would advise you to make haste and get off but I am afraid you might offer some of the same sort of advice to me, so I will keep quiet on that score. Clint was a good looking fellow. Chalk and him would have been a very handsome couple traveling down life’s rugged road together, but probably she has her heart placed on one fine specimen of the masculine gender, probably a minister-- what do you think of the picture. I have heard it was an ill omen for the wedding cake to fall. Was it cut or did it fall by accident or its own accord? Enclosed you will find a ring for Dora sewed to paper, a pearl sun with branches on each side.

We have nothing of interest to write or talk about, only what we have to eat for the coming meal. I can boast of a half pint of meal and spoonful of salt for breakfast with plenty of water. I will send you a ring soon like this if you admire the pattern.

I must close. Write to me soon and often. This is my birthday but you cannot guess my age.[note]John Haun was 30.[/note] Goodbye for the present. My regards to Dora and love to Ruby.

I remain your friend,

J.J.H.
