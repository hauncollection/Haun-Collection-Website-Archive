My Dear Friend,

Yours of the 27th has been received and I immediately hasten to respond. I am very very glad indeed the arrival of my letter was hailed with pleasure but am sorry to think you were surprised to receive it. I cannot see why you should be. I can assure you there is nothing that affords me more pleasure than to receive a letter written by your own hands.

Secondly why is it you came to the determination not to write to me? Surely you have some reason for so doing. “Is it any fault of mine?” If so I think you should let me know and at least allow me the privilege of defending myself, setting it to rights if possible. I thought I had waited sufficiently long after your departure for a letter to cause me to think it a little strange. I thought perhaps you did not like to write first or else did not wish a correspondence with me at all. Please explain yourself.

You say you are too forgiving just as if I had been guilty of some heinous crime. If I have done anything that has met with your displeasure I am perfectly ignorant of it and hope you will forgive me, for I have not felt at all like myself since I have been in Kentucky this time. You should rather sympathize than blame me. You know I have often told you that you possessed a forgiving disposition, a trait of character by no means to be despised, but on the contrary when possessed by a lady causes her to appear more amiable and lovely—just why I admire you so much your sweet disposition. Perhaps I had better refrain or you will think I am trying to flatter you but I can tell you I am in earnest, that I “never was more so in my life” I am sure. I sent you all of my love; am I not entitled to a small portion of yours? I think so.

You speak of a mother’s love. It is true; what is there like a mother’s love, pure and disinterested as it is? I imagine none so pure and lasting. Mother—there is a magic in the name I too have experienced and been influenced by the love and teaching of a kind and devoted mother. No one loves like a mother. It has been truly said when all forsake us she still clings the closer to her child and is willing to overlook our faults and foibles.

Mollie I think you are slightly mistaken, I do not remember saying your picture should not hang in my kitchen. In the first place I do not possess the above named place. Since you twit me about my modesty I will tell you when I try to behave myself you will not let me. One fault I think is the lady in the picture tries too hard to expose her beautiful charms to the public gaze, so upon the whole think it a little vulgar to adorn the parlor of a modest female. But nevertheless I admire such things and will never forgive you if you remove it from its present position where I cannot get to see it easily. The frame I think lovely; you shall not trade it off if I can help it, and I think I can. Dora says you had choice. I told her if there was anything vulgar or smutty about either of them, your choice would certainly be that one—just like you.

The reasons I scratched out some of my letter was that it contained a great deal of love and I thought you might not like it so well. It was as follows: I never knew how much I loved you until your absence. Do not take a sick spell over it and take to your bed, for I meant just what I said. You never would allow me to tell you how much I loved you, but you cannot prevent me from writing it. The reason I requested you to burn my letter was I was afraid someone might get hold of it and see all of the blunders in it. I know you would do as you pleased in regard to it any how, as you generally do where in I am concerned.

The reason I did not put Mr or Miss to your cousin’s name was I did not know which it was. Ask your cousin to please excuse me this time and not to think I do not wish to show her the respect that is due a lady, and I will not be guilty of the like again. It is all your fault. You might have written to me how to direct it but you are so contrary sometimes there is no doing anything with you. If you don’t quit being so contrary I will think you are not so amiable after all. Neither shall you go with me to see sister Fannie.

Now you have it you say I did not even ask you to come home. The reason is just this: I thought you were enjoying yourself finely and of course I would not have your enjoyment to cease just to gratify me. I would rather see you happy than be instrumental in making you unhappy. Mollie, does not this look like pure disinterested love for you? What do you think of it?

It is reported that Lizzie Putter and John Elliott are married and off, of course. Mollie it does look like we are destined to be separated. I suppose if it is so decreed it must be for the best, but I suppose it is natural for mankind to find fault and murmur at the dispensation of providence when very often it is for our own good.

Mollie, I am making my calculations to leave this part of the country shortly, so if you wish to see me, you had better come home one of these days.

Mollie Hawkins is also married to a yank Lieutenant. A young lady asked me the other day why I let you go away and stay so long. I told her you did not belong to me and of course I could do nothing with you. She paid you quite a compliment said you was the prettiest lady in town but I told her I thought you was anything else but pretty.

I believe I have in important news to write you. Dora says I am the greatest flatterer she ever saw because I said she was fine looking. Do you think she does me justice? I know you don’t. Dora has been quizzing me to find out our secrets. She says she would like to know whether we are engaged or not. One minute I tell her we are not and the next that we are. She says I am so aggravating that she cannot understand. You and I, we wont tell her any of our secrets. She asked me if you kissed me when we first met this time and I told her yes, and more too, you embraced me also. She says she heard us kiss. I denied it at first but she said it was no use, that she had ears as well as other folks. Your pa comes in to see me when I am in the parlor. Your ma condescends to come in sometimes to see me. I think I am gaining favor with the old folks a little—they used to never come in at all. Probably they took me to be what I am, a very bashful, modest young man.

There has been a negro man speaking to the darkies in town recently urging the men to take their wives out of the wash tub and let the pretty white ladies take their places, that in the south white ladies are glad to marry negro soldiers. The consequence is a great many are leaving the town and country all the time. Will Crocket’s and Mrs Findley’s have nearly all gone. Also some of Billie Graves’.

I have not seen Dora for nearly two weeks and cannot tell you any news about home but I suppose she has written you more than I could tell you. I believe I have given you all of the news I can think of at present. John West and wife are in Georgetown, I suppose to make it their home. Looks like most everyone that leaves town will come back sooner or later. It must be a very enticing little town, even I could not stay away from it a great while.

I will close now, Ruby, write soon and for goodness sake send me some love when you do write. If I did not ask you to come home I would like to see you nevertheless. We will not send you your duds or clean rags either. We would rather you come after them. If you are a bad girl we want to see you sometimes. As ever your true friend and lover. Please accept of my best love and heart felt wishes for your welfare,

J.J.H.

P.S. I send some stamps not because I think you cannot get any but it is not always convenient to walk to the office. When you write these are for you to write to me. No excuses. Goodbye Ruby until I see you.
