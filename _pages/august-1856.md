<strong>Friday 1</strong> - All hands lounging about. An evening of rest in the barn.

<strong>Saturday 2</strong> - We are not doing much. Rains is on a bust. Henry hitched up his team and 14 took a ride by Judkins’ mill to Betsy Town and home again. John and Dave came over, as Hickman went after them with horses.

<strong>Sunday 3</strong> - Most of the family took a ride up as far as they could go with a stage towards Nelson Creek, took dinner in the woods, and came back the same day. I was quite unwell and  sent Hickman to Dr. Cate to get some medicine, which I took. Rains is still drunk.

<strong>Monday 4</strong> - I feel somewhat better. Lindley left for Hopkins Creek. The District Judge came to hold court and two lawyers with him. We commenced to thresh out wheat with Daniel Cates’ machine.

<strong>Tuesday 5</strong> - Lindley came home this A.M. and after noon we got done with the wheat, as there is but little. Two sacks flour, $12.50. Rains is still on a bust. Opened court.

<strong>Wednesday 6</strong> - Henry, John, my wife, Cath and Mrs. Lindley all went on horseback to Nelson Creek to see the mines. We came back before dark. I sent my wheat to mill this A.M. After, we were hauling in our oats and wheat straw.
