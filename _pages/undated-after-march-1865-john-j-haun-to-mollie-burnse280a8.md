Miss Mollie,

I threw a note at the door this morning as I passed Mr IO's but it dropped about the end window. I will try another as I go up and see if I can hit the door. I suppose you were dreaming the happy hour away, as the house was closed up. I saw someone open the door at the porch and look out as if they were nearly frozen. I thought it was Tootsey herself. Your folks are all well at home. Mrs A. Jenkins is still sick but is better.  Yours &amp;c,

H.
