Mr Haun, my dear friend,

After you left Sunday evening, Cousin Fannie and I did a little primping and took a delightful stroll. We also called on some young ladies. You were going to stay such a short time that I would not leave you long enough to perform my toilet. You I may presume had a pleasant ride home as it was a pretty evening.

I received a letter from Dora tonight. She did not say anything about you calling by our house. She also sent me a letter form Mr King who is at present in Kentucky and will be at our house next month. Sallie McConell was here to see me yesterday evening. I went home with her and stayed all night. Mr Waits being away, she insisted on me going to stay with her all night and in the mean time he came, so you know that broke into my arrangements.

I received a card from Mr Woolman soliciting my company for church, after you left, so you see I don’t have much time to get lonesome. I received two letters yesterday, also two today. I wish you were here to answer them. I never slept two hours last night, and do not fell like writing to night, but I promised you a letter Saturday and we expect to spend the day out tomorrow if pleasant and then attend the society at the orphan school tomorrow night, and I you know, will never disappoint you when it is in my power to prevent it, for sometimes I feel that I am unworthy of the regard you bestow on me, and sometimes think that I am cross with you, but you generous heart will forgive me all offenses.

But I did not tell you what disturbed my rest. It was my tooth as usual, but it is now well and when I get home expect to make up for lost time. I have not seen Drack since you left, but received a letter. He says he is afraid he is like Caesar when he crossed the Rubicon—too late, alas too late. But I intend to tell him Madam Rumor is an vile dame and he must not listen to her tales. Don’t you think I am a bad girl. But you know girls must have some fun as long as they are misses. I am not saying that I intend to mistreat Drack at all, no, no.

I was just wondering if you could read this. Ed is up in my room writing his composition, as their is no fire in their room, and he is shaking the table all the time. But I must drop a few lines home so you will excuse this for the present.

From your Mollie in _______

P.S. Write soon and burn this up.

M.C.B.
