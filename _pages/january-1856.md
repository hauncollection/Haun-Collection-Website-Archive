<strong>Tuesday 1 </strong>- Clear and cold last night and today. John is about the cabin with a bad cold. I, Dave, Rains, and Shults are putting up the cabin. Rains and Shults haul the logs, and I and Dave notch and hew them down. I think it is a little romantic to be fixing up cabins as if we expected to have diggins to last here while we stay in California, or as if we wished to stay in this country.

<strong>Wednesday 2</strong> - Clear and cold last night, but a littler warmer today. I did not put my coat on today, as I kept at work notching and hewing, and some times helping to haul logs.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">John went down to the Point. He got Liz a pair of shoes priced at $2 and some other things for his ma. I took out of my trunk four towels that my wife had me to bring from home. They had not been used until New Years.</span>

<strong>Thursday 3 </strong>- Clear and cold night and during the day—it was somewhat cooler today than yesterday. We’ve got two ridge poles for the door sawed out, and the rest of the timber hauled that we want, except the boards to cover the new cabin in.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We have a greater variety to eat since my wife has come to our cabins. We are all setting around a good fire in my cabin except Dave—he is in the other cabin. John is playing the fiddle.</span>

<strong>Friday 4</strong> - The weather moderated considerable. It was cloudy most of the day.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We finished putting up the ridge poles. We cut a tree and set it on  blocks and sawed it to make boards.</span>

<strong>Saturday 5</strong> - Rather warm and cloudy. We succeeded in splitting and putting the boards on the house. We still have the shed is to cover yet. Cloudy.

<strong>Sunday 6</strong> - Cleared up again. We were busy most of the day. I made a shaving horse and did some other tinkering. David commenced to make himself a chair. My wife did some mending. Shults and Rains went down to the Point and reported a very interesting mock trial going on, in which a Dutch shoemaker was plaintiff. John put two legs on an old chair.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I, Dave, Liz, Shults, and Rains were riding down the hill on two slides in the morning. I read the three last chapters of Second and Corinthians.</span>

<strong>Monday 7</strong> - Clear and not very cold. We all five were at work on the cabin by noon. The shed between the cabins was covered and timber brought to chink the cabin.

P.M. Dave and John put down the two corners under the shed and hewing the end logs under the shed &amp;c —

<strong>Tuesday 8</strong> - Clouded up this morning and continued all day. John and Dave finished the floor and sawed out two windows. Shults and Rains were chinking the cracks. I was framing up the door.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">In the afternoon I did nothing of consequence. The rest of the boys done the same. They went up the hill and hauled down a slide load of wood.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">My wife is very much displeased with the language I use in talking to her, or at least says she is </span>—
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We caught a grey squirrel today in our cabin and have him chained and in a box.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">At dark it was inclined to mist or rain, but only slightly.</span>

<strong>Wednesday 9</strong> - Raining and snowing last night and all of today. Dave was at work at his chair. Shults and John was helping my wife and Lizzy to wash all the dirty clothes and socks that was on hand. I and Rains went down to the Point to get a cook stove and found two—one at $45 and one at $65. One was too small, the other too high priced.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I met Cooper and Sockum. Cooper wanted to sell out his interest in the Sockum ditch, as he and others had nothing to eat nor money to buy with. H. Bray went over to Illinois Ranch with them.</span>

<strong>Thursday 10</strong> - Snowing considerable this morning. After breakfast I and Dave started for the Sockum diggins. We caught up with Bray and Cooper at Martin’s Ranch and then went on to the diggins. H. Bray bought one of the company out at $333 and I bought Cooper out at the same, there being three shares in the ditch and one working interest owned by Gorge Taylor. All three of them came over with us. Cooper stays with us tonight.

<strong>Friday 11</strong> - Still snowing of nights and days at intervals. The boys worked at the Pike Ditch to get the water to run down it. I and Cooper went down to the Point and closed the trade by allowing I.W. Thompson &amp; Co. to buy out Taylor and make four interests in the ditch. They payed us $26 each, making my interest 1/4, which cost $307 instead of $333. Duesler and Brooks came home with me and stayed all night.

<strong>Saturday 12</strong> - Snowed several inches last night and raining and snowing a little at intervals today. After Duesler and Brooks left we all went the Pike Ditch and got the water to run down. In the afternoon we shoveled out the snow near the diggins. The water still continues to run on, but weakly—rather too much snow and ice.

<strong>Sunday 13</strong> - The sun shone out warm and pleasant nearly all day, though it was somewhat cloudy late this evening. The boys hauled one load of wood on sledges down hill to burn. I and Rains took a dull root axe, and went down to the Point and ground it. Dave and John went up the Pike Ditch and stopped a leak, then came down to the Point to assist in getting home a cook stove if we found a suitable one, but went home with out any. Rains stayed on a spree. I read the books of Philippians and Colossians.

<strong>Monday 14</strong> - Warm and sunny most of the day. I mended up my gum boots. John and Dave went out to the diggins. Shults was rocking today.

P.M. We went up the Pike Ditch and stopped some holes and continued down to the diggins. A sluice head is running through the boxes. I shoveled the snow out of them. They have ice in them, the hoses have still got ice froze in them.

<strong>Tuesday 15 </strong>- Cloudy and rained very lightly last night. The sun shone out warm this forenoon.

P.M. It clouded up, and is somewhat cooler. I, John and Dave worked on the lower end of the ditch and let the water on the hose and thawed out the ice. After noon we did some mining. We cleaned up and got about one dollar. Rains is out.

John was cleaning up some bedrock in the A.M. After noon we was piping until the hose burst. We cleaned up and got gold $6.50.

<strong>Thursday 17</strong> - Clear and cold last night. After breakfast I and Dave started for Betsey Town. We took dinner at Quincy with Duesler then went on and met Rains at O’Neal’s Ranch. He turned and went with us. I engaged a cook stove of Blood and Company at $75, then went back to Quincy when I stayed all night with Duesler.

<strong>Friday 18</strong> - Still cold and clear last night, and warm today. After consulting about some old law business and other things we started for home, arriving about 3:00 P.M.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Rather too cold for mining.</span>

<strong>Saturday 19</strong> - Cold and frosty last night and not very warm today, though the sun shone out bright and clear all day. We all were putting in our time about the new cabin.

P.M. Hossulcuth brought a cook stove for us but we had to haul it up on a slide from the road. We set it up but got a hole to put through the roof for the pipe.

<strong>Sunday 20</strong> - Cold last night. The sun shone out warm in the A.M. After breakfast we set to work and fixed up the kitchen. My wife and Liz got dinner on the stove and moved the tables and cooking tools in the kitchen.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Clouded up this P.M. I read the three first chapters of Paul’s First Epistle to Timothy.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We knocked up four old sluice boxes and got gold $4.50.</span>

<strong>Monday 21</strong> - Cloudy, then sun shone out. Cloudy again in the P.M. John, Dave and Bill was mining all day, but did not clean up. I was putting in a cupboard. I made the door and hung it, put on wash boards. H. Bray came up late P.M., &amp;c. Stayed all night —

<strong>Tuesday 22 </strong>- Snowing this morning and some last night. The three boys were cleaning up bedrock till noon and got gold $58.50. I and Bray went out to the diggins in the A.M. He then went home.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I was putting up some shelves in the kitchen.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">It has been raining and snowing all day and continues up to a late  bedtime.</span>

<strong>Wednesday 23</strong> - Snowed last night and is still at it. I was getting wood to build a fire. I saw a coyote near our cabin but he ran off.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">The boys went up the Pike Ditch to stop the holes. They soon got down a pipe head and to spare. I was fixing the kitchen door.</span>

P.M. Dave went up the Pike Ditch to stop a leak, and us three went to run the water in the deep cut on the left, as the right hand channel is worked out. We were the rest of the evening running  out snow and ice, and setting some boxes.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Very cold this evening.</span>

<strong>Friday 25</strong> - Cold and frosty last night and continues so this morning. The boys was getting wood by hauling it downhill on slides.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I took down the first table that I put up in ‘53 to eat on, and put up a water shelf in its place, and made a false bottom for a sluice box.</span>

P.M. We went out to the diggins, mended up two sluice boxes and set them.

<strong>Saturday 26</strong> - Still colder last night than usual. There is no water running in the ditch this morning. After the sun had warmed up the atmosphere, the boys were hauling down some wood. I and Dave went up the Pike Ditch and stopped a hole made by freezing up the ground. They let all the water run out of the ditch.

P.M. Nothing done of consequence. I and Rains cut up a cedar stump that stood partially under the entry. Frank Fox came up to invite the women down to the Point to a private party, but they did not go.

<strong>Sunday 27 </strong>- Cold last night, but the snow is a little softened from the rays of the sun. John went down to the Point got some sole leather $.50 to put on his gum boots. They had a Dewell and spree over at the Dutchman last night and this morning, I read the 9th, 10th, and 11th chapters of Paul’s Letter to the Hebrews.

<strong>Monday 28</strong> - Cold last night but clouded up and snowed all day lightly. We all stayed in the cabins till noon. Bray and Sockum came up to see me. After dinner we three started for the Sockum diggins but stayed all night at the Illinois Ranch.

<strong>Tuesday 29</strong> - Rained, but snowed most last night.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">After an early breakfast the company started for the diggins and water ditch four miles away, and then two miles up the ditch to get a good pipe head. We then returned to Massac diggins to ascertain if the miners would pay us for the use of the water. They said they do not want to buy water, so I and Sockum went up the ditch again and let the water out so it would not run down to them. We then went down below the partnership ditch and turned their water out of our ditch into a little ditch below ours and started for home.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I ate supper, lodged and breakfasted at the Illinois Ranch. Terwilliger put the Arapahoes on two pack mules for me and Bray to ride over to Nelson, and himself rode on a horse. I got home just before night. My wife had scrubbed the floor and hung up a curtain across the cabin just in front of our bunks—all nice.</span>

<strong>Wednesday 30</strong> - Cloudy last night. Some little frozen snow was falling on the roof after I went to bed.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">This morning it is raining, and continued all day lightly. We all went out to mining after dinner except John. Shults was helping us.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Cooper came over. I paid him off for his Sockun’s ditch and diggins, a balance of $153. Bray came over and stayed all night with us. We got gold $13.50. Still thawing.</span>

<strong>Thursday 31</strong> - Cloudy this morning. We were mining early. John and Bray shouldered their blankets and put out for the Sockum Diggins. Our hose tore in the A.M.
