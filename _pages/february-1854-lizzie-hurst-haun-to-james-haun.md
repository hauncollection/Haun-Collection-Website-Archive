</em></p>
<span style="margin-left: 460px;">Georgetown[note]James Haun recorded the receipt of this letter on <a title="April 1854" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/version-iii-series-i/april-1854/">April 9 1855</a>.[/note]</span>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dear Uncle and Cousin,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I sit down tonight, after Aunty and Dr Hamill have gone to church, to write you a few lines. I have been a little sick all day. I thought I would not go to church, but write to Dear Old Uncle. I wrote you a letter a few weeks ago and have written John one. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Aunt Lizzie has joined the Presbyterian church. We had some shooting done last week </span>between Lawyer Robinson’s son Jimmie and H. Hynes. I suppose John knew Mr Hynes. He was a military student. He was dismissed a few months ago, or rather expelled. The difficulty arose about Ellen Finell Robinson shot[note]This incident is also discussed in Martha Haun's letter of February 2 1854, available <a title="February 2 1854" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/version-iii-series-ii/february-2-1853-martha-haun-to-james-haun/">here</a>.[/note]</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[torn] but did not kill him
</span>[torn] longer and they have not
[torn] with Robinson yet it is supposed
[torn] and Hynes engaged to be married but</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I do not know whether it is true or not. Hynes was taken up to Mrs Finell’s the next morning after he was shot. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mr Clark is married. He married Miss Eve Stenson of Paris, Kentucky. It is just one year </span>today since you left; it seems to me a very long year. Oh, Uncle, you cannot imagine how bad I want to see you all. I wrote to Dave not long ago.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I haven't any news of importance to write so I<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>must come to a close. Church will soon </span>be out. Give my love to John. Aunt says she is going to write after she comes from church. You must write me a letter, for it would do me a  good deal of good to get a letter from you and John. I must bring my short letter to a close. Tell John Frank Rankig sends his love to him. There was one person joined the reform church today by letter. Her name is Mrs Benton a lady of about 85 years old. She was a back member of dry run church I believe and her letter came to town. You must answer this. Goodbye.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I remain your ever affectionate daughter,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Lizzie Haun
</span><span class="s1" style="line-height: 1.5;">or rather </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Hurst</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">P.S. I believe I will change my name to Haun. Excuse all mistakes, for I wrote this in a hurry.</span></p>
