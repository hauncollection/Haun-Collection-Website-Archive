<p style="padding-left: 90px;">        Georgetown June the 27th 1853</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My Dear Husband,</p>
     This is Sunday morning
&amp; while our church bell was ringing for meeting
I received your kind &amp; long looked for letter, this
is the second one I have received since you landed
in California, oh how glad &amp; yet how sorry I
am to hear from you sorry because I am not
with you to share your hard life as I expect it
is &amp; I think I could be of more use out there than
here, oh how it makes my heart ache when I think
of you &amp; imagine you see a hard time, but this is
the lot of the human family. &amp; the easier we ake
it the better--- I am well &amp; lizze &amp; all the
negroes, but broke down in body &amp; Spirits I
have just come in from the country from seeing
the last of my brother James Hurst he is no more
he bid a decees to this troublesome world on
tuesday knight last at half past one o clo--
he lay sixteen days &amp; suffered more than any
human being I ever saw the Drs say it was an
affection of the spine he had no use of his limbs
except his hands &amp; arms, &amp; had spasms every ten
or fifteen minutes or cramps his uncles were down
almos out of joint, oh my dear if you could have
been by his bed side you would have see what
religion could do in a dying hour. I never did nor
never expect to see a gain such a glorious triump
over death, he said from the first he would not
get well he had no desire to do so every moment
when free from pain was spent in prayrs &amp; exortation
up to the last hour of his life a few hours before
he died he told us to sing we sung Jesus thou
art the Sinners friends-- he raised his trembling
hands &amp; tried to shout &amp; said in a whisper for he
could not then speak a bove a whisper how I crave to
be with the lord he was then breathing short and hevy
the last words he said was Sweet Jesus thou hast
sent thy ministiring Angels to hover round my bed
Ganoe preached his funeral before he was buried
there was a great many at the burying &amp; a house
full all the time he was sick, I mourn his loss
but reJoice to know that he has made a happy
exchange of worlds, for his has been a life of
toil &amp; sorow, there is now but three of left
in this country, -- Mrs Smarr died sudenly
on monday morning last with disease of the breast
she had a baby &amp; died in ten minutes after the
child was dead born----
Dave Runion has bought Stevensons store &amp; going in to
buisiness here a gain, Dan Runion is married to Miss
Sally Black burn he had a hard time to get her they an
attempt to run a way but her farther Dr church B
lackburn Stopt them, he then kept her so clost that they
could not make an other effort for several weeks
but with the assistance of the young men here
they succeeded in getting off. They are in Maysville

dan if he ever see him--- Louis West &amp; Bled

kind to me &amp; I do not take sides with either the

set of people upon earth. bert &amp; betty are stil

distance to the examination &amp; comencement of the
baptist schools which comes off this coming week

knight. the old man Hollzclaw cannot get
his boys bailed out there is no one will go their
bail-- the old man Hollzclaw cannot get
his boys bailed out there is no one will go their
bail-- I had but a faint idea of the dissipatio
of this town until I have been boarding here
I am truly glad my son is not here for I do think
of this place cannot be beat for idleness &amp; drunkin
ness any where on earth there is not one man
out of every ten that pretends to do any thing but
set a bout &amp; drink whiskey &amp; talk it is really dis
gusting to see &amp; know the men spend their
time here- I am treated kind &amp; well by every
body &amp; have as many friends as I ever could have
any where but it is no place to have a son in idle
ness in how men can spend their time in the way they
do I cannot til without being miserable bats wife
is expected to die she has disease of the heart---
property is stil down here &amp; prospect of its
getting up again this is a great fruit year here
though verry dry at present &amp; has been for some
weeks--- W G has not written to me
since he left here he promised to do so but
has not neither does Jane write, I have heard
nothing from John Hurst since I wrote you be
fore, I would like to know if you &amp; John has received all the letters I have written you
let me know in your next---
my dear husband write to me &amp; tell me how
you fair &amp; how you are treated by henry, from
what WG told me he is verry selfish him
&amp; cath they care for no one but then selves &amp;
are not disposed to befriend any of their kin
&amp; oh for gods sake do not let my child be
imposed on by either of them for henry has
imposed on me enough without treating my
child a miss say nothing henry a bout what
WG says he told me not to write to you any
thing what he said that you would see for
your self, I fear you &amp; John gets nothing you
can eat &amp; oh if you should get sick who
will do any think for you my dear write
me all the particulars write me every thing
how you get a long with henry &amp; keep nothing
from me I often think of how you stand
cath she is such a rough derly lazy creature
I know it is hard for you to stand her ways
&amp; tell John for me never to become rough &amp;
low on his mamers under no circumstances-
&amp; tell me what your prospect is for making
money, if you could only get four or five thou
sand dollars do not stay but come back &amp; lets
live to gather &amp; make a living helping each
other if you could get a few thousand dollars
to start on with the help we have we could
make a good living by all going to work &amp; at
tending properly to business so let me intreat
you as soon as you are commenced you can do
nothing there to come home tell me how you
do a bout cloths your washing &amp; a bout
your eating &amp; every thing, if you only knew how
I imagion you live &amp; how it troubles me you
would write me all a bout it. my dear I
have all confidence that you will act wisely &amp;
not dispair or get low spirited for John sake &amp;
I know you are phylossipher enough to know
that is not the way to remidy any thing but
keep lively &amp; cheerful under all or any circumstan
ces for the sake of your health &amp; to keep others
from taking advantage of you for a melancholly
disponding man is not fit for business or
any thing else &amp; pray do not let John give
way to melancholly or low spirits-
for if you can do nothing there you can come
back &amp; have more &amp; do as well as hundreds
here if I could only know you were living
&amp; cheerful I would feel so much better as
for my self I am compelled banish melancholly
if I want to live &amp; hve any health for low
spirits affects my health sooner than any thing
else on earth. then let us be wise &amp; not
make our short lives more miserable than they
need be tell me all a bout John how
he seems to be any how &amp; every how
&amp; how he talks &amp; tell him for me to
write me just exactly his situation &amp; opinion
a bout things tell him not to neg
lect writing to me you said you &amp; him
was busy but did not say what
every one seems anxious to hear from there
has been a great many here to day to enquire
after you, Mrs Holtzclaw says you must
not forget your promise to write all about
the country. I can not name the peo
ple that send their love to &amp; respects to
you it would take a whole page to
put down their names, but almost
every body you knew here, the negroes
are all well &amp; going well the babys
are growing finely, Sam &amp; bet is verry
studdy &amp; works hard &amp; behaves them
selves Just as well as white people
&amp; in fact a great deal better. I think
more of them than I ever did in my
life every one in town says they are
the best servants they ever knew &amp; I
do think they are the best pricipled negro
es I ever saw, I now am convinced that kind
treatment makes the best negroes now my
dear husband if you think you would like to have me
there Just say to me what would be the best time for me
to start &amp; I will arrange my affairs so as to
go I think I can do it &amp; more over if you expect to
stay there two or three years I think I could make
as much money if I was out there as any of you a
womans labor being worth so much. I am anxious
to go how would it do for me &amp; kit to go out we
could start from New orleans no danger
a bout her until we got out there, what do you
think it write to me immediately. I think
Kit &amp; I could make a keap if we were out
there, &amp; I know we can get there if you say
so I believe I could get sant to go with us
what say you will you let us come. I am so anx
ious to be with you if you think it would do let
me know as soon as possible I know I can stand
the trip for I would start with a big resolution
&amp; that is half the battle, now my dear husband
I must big you farewell for this time &amp; remember
my heart is with you where ever you may be &amp; will
ever be while you &amp; I are on this earth no matter
what distance seperates us my feelings are  the
same &amp; it would be my greatest happiness to
share life with you in any way be it hard or easy
my love to my boy &amp; tell him his ma loves
him better than her own life &amp; he must write me
farewell my kind husband, I remain your
devoted until death
