<span style="margin-left: 430px;">October the 18th 1854[note]James Haun recorded the receipt of this letter in his diary on <a title="December 1854" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/version-iii-series-i/december-1854/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 4 1854</a>.[/note]</span>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My Sweet Husband,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I received your kind and welcome letter this morning with a check for two hundred dollars for which I am truly thankful. I had written a part of a letter<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>last night to you but I commence again. I received a letter from you just two weeks before this last one dated the 15th of August.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are all well and have been all summer. I am getting along as well as any one could, I suppose, in my situation. Thomas Kimell and family are going to keeping house. In a week or two I will have no more family this winter than I can help, owing to the scarcity and high price of eatables. It is a loosing business to keep two or three boarders: they will not pay more than three dollars a piece a week, and that will not begin to do, the way provisions are selling. Now meal is one dollar per bushel, flour five dollars a hundred, butter 25 and 30 cents per pound, and beef 8 cents a pound, sugar hams 15 cents and common hams 12 1/2 cents a pound. So you see everything is as high again as it was when board was two and a half dollars a week, and boards will not pay but fifty cents more</span>—it will bring anyone into debt to feed them now at that price, to say nothing about the fuel they burn. So, I will have no family this winter but Liz and myself of white ones, and then we are not obliged to have things no matter at what price. Sam’s work will feed us all, or very near it. There has nothing been raised here this summer on account of the drought. Irish potatoes has been a dollar a bushel all summer, sweet potatoes two dollars. There is little or no fruit.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I stay at home nearly all the time I do all I can I keep myself busy to pass off the time and feel much better satisfied that way than in company. I miss you and John more when in company than I do at home with my family attending to my business. I go to church of Sundays and to prayer meetings and my friends stop in to see me occasionally. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have abandoned all thought of going to California. Tom Johnson talked to me about it advised me not to go. He said living in the mines was so different from living any other place and again he said it would not cost you less than three thousand dollars for me to go and stay a year. On Tuesday Billy Graves come to see me and advised me not to go. He said he knew how we felt both as about being apart, but he said I would only be a hindrance. I am an expense to you and it would not be the satisfaction to us that we might imagine to be together there in the situation we would have to be. He also said you were trying to make money and I ought to be contented to stay here and take care and be as little expense as I could. So, considering all things, I think it best to give it up and content myself to stay where I am, praying for the time to come when you and John will come home. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Billy Graves has showed a disposition to be very kind to me. He came to me a few weeks after you left and told me that any thing he could do to befriend me in any way he would take a pleasure in doing it if I would let him know. He has several times told me the same thing. Oh, how much more kind to me are stranger than connections</span>—that is a thing I have fully tested in my life. It is true. Thornton Moore has said to me, “you are welcome to come and stay at my house,” and I thought of doing so before I went to housekeeping. I went out on a visit and stayed a week or two. That convinced me that I could not live there. It is my wish to save money when and where I can, but live there I cannot. I had rather live in any hard situation upon earth if I can live in peace. So I am determine let what will befall me never to go to any of my kin for a home. I will do the best I can, but to put myself in a situation to be tyrannized over by kin I never will. Liz sent in for me last Saturday. I went and stayed until Sunday evening. They are kind to me in their way; they send for me about once a month. I will not hire a horse and buggy to go to see anyone.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have not heard from Dave for several weeks. You know I told you in one of my letters that Dave said if I was so anxious to go to California he would go with me</span>—but in his last letter to me he said he could not go this winter so I have given it up. All things considered I think it best.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tom White’s property was all sold by the sheriff last week, or rather he sold it, but was compelled to do so. The house sold to Henry Rucker for sixteen hundred dollars. They have moved up to her mothers. There is no news much of any sort in town that I hear of. Property is still very low. You seem to have a great many friends judging from the inquires they make about you. The church is just about as it was when you left. There are a great many who say to me, “give my love to you when I write.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tom Johnson and Laura left a week ago for San Francisco. They are coming back in the spring Mrs Miller takes it very hard parting from Laura. I think you and John will come in the spring. I feel like you will. I have made you a large jar of peach preserves and tell John I made him a two gallon jar of the nicest brandy peaches I ever made. I intend to keep them sealed up for him until he comes, let it be long or a short time. Your precious Liz has made you both a beautiful pair of slippers and I am knitting you socks. I have kept the shirt you took off the morning you left just as you wore it and a collar of John’s as he wore it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Oh how I pray for the time to come when we will all be together once more, for I had rather live five years with you my dear husband than fifty without you. Oh, when I can throw myself in your arms again for protection and sympathy and love and accompany you and everything. It will be more than happiness to me then. If you feel as I do you will make the time as short as you possibly can. Frank Rankin told me he got a letter from John the same day I got the other one of yours. He came down and told me about it. It seemed to please him very much. He said he never got a letter that done him so much good in his life. He said he answered it immediately. I had like to have forgotten to tell you that old Ben Ford is dead. He died of old age, I suppose. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Give yourself no uneasiness about me but keep in good spirits, looking forward to the time when we will see each other. Oh what a stimulus to have that to anticipation, it buoys me up to overcome my feelings, all the unpleasant ones, to think that the time is not far distant when I will see you. I have so often thought of a poor widow that had no hope. What would I do if it was not for the hope of seeing you again? But I do hope and it cheers me up; let it do the same with you</span>—</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lizzie is going to school. She sends her love to you and John. Now my sweet husband I must bid you farewell. Tell my boy his mother loves him as devotedly as ever he is truly a part of my heart &amp; not neglect to write. I have sent him a long letter some time ago. Write me as often as you can, for it is the greatest pleasure I have, and, oh, do not let your love grow cold, for mine never can. Farewell my idols. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your devoted wife until this heart ceases to feel joy or pain, </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Martha Haun</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Look at this, uncle I have a friend to write you a letter for I know you got it, so I will just put a little scribbling in. Good bye, Lizzie</span></p>
