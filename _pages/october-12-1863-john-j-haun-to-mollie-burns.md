Prison No. 3 Barracks 50
Camp Chase Oct 12th

Dear Friend

I received your anxiously looked for letter
on the seventh. I had began to think my
letter had not reached its distination
and was just on the eve of writing ano
ther when it came. I had concluded you
had taken me at my word and was waiting
for two letters before you answered mine
I never thought for a moment you would
disreguard your promise concerning your
Bourbon visit. Therefore looked for this
letter with more eagerness if possible than
any other. Well you give a glowing discript
ion of your visit and things a bout Paris
Surely times must be getting better in
Ky since the departure of some of her
citizens. I am truly glad to hear you are en
joying yourself so finely So Samuel L.
is married at last. I thought that would
have taken place ere this nothing prevent
ing but a slight indication on his part
as I understand. It seems the girls are all mar
ring for fear there will be no one to marry
when the war is over They are right I suppose
I suppose the Misses Wells are the most fas
hionable and wealthy more hears of the
town. I believe the girls generally fancy
merchants. So Tillie is about to go into the
matrimonial state. Joy be with them. I thou
ght Hat was in Canada with several
others from our town but it seems I have
been mistaken. I remember the name of Cole
ord very well but have forgotten his featur
es at any rate I suppose he is a good fellow as
bachelors are generally and not cross and cra
bbed as some people term them. I saw WAl
lace Graves immediately after he was kill
ed literally torn to pieces by a shell I suppose
Mr Graves takes very hard for Wallace
was his favorite of the boys. this truly a sad
sight to see the boys come home in such a
way I have had very good health until with
in a week past have not been well. one
of our county boys died in my mess since we
have been here with a sore throat several oth
ers have been sick also. Mollie this is truly a
cold gloomy place with plenty of mud when
it rains. The reason I asked Fannie L if she kn
ew Mr Grimes one evening while taking my ac
customed walk I overheard part of a letter read
and the name of Miss L of G town when I began
to inquire and found it was Fannie Of course
I will have to wait until you have a wedding bef
ore I can get an invitation I should like very
much to come home but my uncle will not
let me. I have not forgotten the ring nor the
associations connected with it Those days
will be remembered by me as one has
said we seldom forget incidents in life that
gives us a great deal of pleasure or pain as
the case might be you accused me of stealing
when I left home that is pretty hard but sup
pose I will have to plead guilty before so fair an
accuser But just tell me what man is there
that could with stand such a temptation with
such a delicate morsel set before him “not I”
I must confess I believe my resolution would
fail me upon such an occasion no matter
how much I would try to resist. But I am
confident when you take another view of the
case they sentence will be compartively light
if we should even chance to meet again
I might commit the same offence If I sh
ould just punish me as my crime deserves
and I will not complain. Mollie take warn
ing of poor Fitzsimmons when you mar
ry and do not whip your husband and make
him commit susan sides. I showed your
letter to one of my mess mates by way of retaliat
tion realiation is fair in war you know. I
recieved a letter from S Harris a few days ago
he was well and did [illegible]
Bangs I Sherritt and some others I am not
acquainted with I sent your kindest regards
to him I received your first letter the evening
they left for Chicago. I have not received a letter
written in one home since I left Ky I heard it through
Mrs West that they were well. does Mat S
drink as hard as he used to ask Dora to write if
is whether he is at home or not
