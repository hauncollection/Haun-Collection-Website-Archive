Dear Friend,

Your letter of the 22nd[note]Not included in this collection.[/note] was received in due time, and this being the sabbath, I will appropriate it to this purpose. I assure you I appreciate it as much or more than any Christmas present I ever received. I feel highly honored to think you stay at home long enough to write me a letter.

Chalk, I like to hear of you enjoying yourself. Where did you find the word Dirty Rebels? I used it in my letter to a lady friend in Georgetown and thought perhaps you had seen or heard of it. Have you or not? It would seem you have turned out to hard dancing. Speaking of the dance at Fryman’s, I never shall forget that eventful evening. Oh what a contrast to that evening and the present time applied to my case! But the hope of getting my liberty ere long has not entirely forsaken me.

Mollie, you see I did as you bid me by writing to Jimmie Crumbaugh. I believe I will take your advice in future; be sure and do not give me any but good. Is it possible that young men are so scarce you have come to the necessity of taking old widowers for escorts to public places? Good heavens, you give a glowing description of him! I see no reason why you should object to a limited number of little horse organs. I am fond of seeing them around ain't you? I used to have some scruples on that point myself but have long since done away with such foolish ideas. If that is your only objection, just take my advice and do not let anything of that sort interfere. Just imagine me promenading at the supper with you for the limited space of five minutes at the expiration of which time the widower can again take his place and eat sweet cakes.

I had heard of the death of Dave May last spring, and also the marriage of my old sweetheart Annie. So Mr Galliham is married. I do think there is a chance for you and I yet but I imagine you have already had several chances from all I can learn—for instance George Jackson.

Mollie you have not failed in your attempt as regards posting me in the news about town and vicinity. As I said before it was indeed a valuable Christmas gift. Just do so again. Mollie my letter must necessarily be very short. I wish I could write as much as I would like—but your letters need not necessarily be any shorter.

Mollie I am making a breast pin, having nothing else to do. You can guess who it is intended for. I wish to deliver it in person. It is useless to say I should like to have been in Georgetown to spend my Christmas.

My kindest regards to Miss Allie Toyman and Miss Dora. Catch her New Years gift for me so I can get it when I see her. Mollie I would give three brass buttons to have a chat with you. Nothing more, while I remain your friend,

J.J.H.

P.S. please excuse this uninteresting letter and I will endeavor to do better next time. I like to unravel such puzzles as you speak of. Write again if you can possibly find time.
