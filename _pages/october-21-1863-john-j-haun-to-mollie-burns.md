Dear Friend,

I received your anxiously looked for letter on the seventh. I had began thinking my letter had not reached it’s destination and was just on the eve of writing another when it came. I owe you an apology for such a long delay in responding, but the delay was unavoidable as I was taken sick shortly after receiving your letter and was unable to write sooner. I am about well again and have been moved to another prison as you will see from the heading.

I never thought for a moment if you would disregard your promise concerning your Bourbon visit. Therefore, I looked for this letter with more eagerness if possible than any other. Well, you give a glowing description of your visit and things about Paris. Surely times must be getting better in Kentucky since the departure of so me of her rebellious subjects. I am so truly glad to learn you are enjoying yourself so finely, if I cannot myself.

So Sam L. is married at last! I thought that would have taken place ere this. Nothing preventing but a slight intoxication on his part as I understand. It seems the girls are all marring for fear there will be no one to marry when the war is over. I suppose the Misses Wills are the most fashionable and wealthy merchants of the town, I believe the girls generally fancy merchants. I thought Mat was in Canada with several others from town but it seems I have been mistaken. I remember the name of Colcord very well but have forgotten his features. At any rate I suppose he is a good fellow, as bachelors are generally, and not cross and crabbed as some people term them.

I saw Wallace Graves immediately after he was killed, literally torn to pieces by a shell. I suppose Mr Graves takes it very hard losing both of his boys within a few months of each other. It is truly a sad sight to see the boys brought home in such a way.

I have had very good health until recently, but nothing very serious and I will be well soon, as you know. I am a healer. Mollie, this is truly cold gloomy place.

The reason I asked Fannie L. if she knew Mr Grimes is this. One evening while taking my accustomed walk I overheard part of a letter read and the name of Miss L of G Town. When I began to inquire I found it was Tom.

Of course I will have to wait until you have a wedding before I can get an invitation. I should like very much to come home but my Uncle Sam will not let me. I have not forgotten the ring nor the associations connected with it. Those days will long be remembered by me. As one has said we seldom forget incidents in life that give us a great deal of pleasure or pain, as the case might be. You accused me of stealing when I left home. That is pretty hard but I suppose I will have to plead guilty before so fair an accuser. But just tell me what man is there that could withstand such a temptation with such a delicate morsel set before him. “Not I” I must confess. I believe my reservation would fail me on such an occasion no matter how much I might try to resist. I am confident when you take another view of the case my sentence will be comparatively light. If we ever should chance to meet again I might commit the same offense. If I should, just punish me as my crime deserves and I will not complain.

Mollie, take warning of poor Fitzsimmons when you marry and do not whip your husband and cause him to commit suicide.

I read your letter to one of my mess mates by way of retaliation. Retaliation is fair in war, you know! I received a letter from S. Harris a few days ago. He was well and said Eph was in his mess, and S.K. Bangs, J. Shermitt and some others I am not acquainted with. I sent your kindest regards to him. I received your first letter the evening they left for Camp Douglas.

Does Mat Saunders drink as hard as he was used to? Ask Dora how Buddie is, and  whether he is at home or not. I have not written or received a letter from home since I left Kentucky. I heard through Mrs S. West that my parents were well. Several pictures have been received by mail but they were badly broken, hence the reason for my tasking you to send it. I have finished your ring and it is pronounced the neatest one made in prison. I would send it in this letter but there has been so many put in letters that have never been received at home. If I do not meet with an opportunity to send it by some individual soon I will send it by mail and risk the chances of its arrival, for you know I want to you to have it. Rings have a way of getting out of letters that leave here unless put in the especial charge of Captain Tiffany the letter deliverer.

I shall commit another theft when I see you, so you can get your punishment ready when you see me. I must close as I have run out of space,

J.J.H.

(Do not put off writing because I did.)
