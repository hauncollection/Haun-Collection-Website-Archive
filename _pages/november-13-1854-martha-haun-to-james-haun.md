<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My own Sweet Husband,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I feel like talking to you this evening and this is all the paper I happen to have but I will only take the move of it. I am sitting all alone by my comfortable little fire. Lizzie is at school. We are all well and I am doing the very best I<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>can, and the best is poor enough in my estimation, though I have no right to complain</span>—</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I wrote to John last week and told him what I thought and have felt about you staying longer than next spring. I do feel that two years is as long as I can well bear to be from you</span>—<span class="s1">though if you think differently I will do my best to bear it longer</span>—<span class="s1">but remember, </span>without you there is not much enjoyment for me. In fact, there is none. It is only a seeming existence without you. I know you have not the most distant idea how lonely I feel. I feel that I stand alone in the world, to contend with it single handed. I will go with you anywhere on earth if you will come for me. It is not worth my while to make a sacrifice of my life for money. I think it sinful and I hardly know which I would prefer: to live two years more without you or die now and be at rest. I do believe I would prefer death to being without you longer. I used to think I could do as well without you as I could without my child, but I was mistaken. Though I love my child with all a mother’s love, yet it is so different from the love to a dear husband. He will, if he lives, form other ties and will be all to that other as you are now to me. You are my company, my comfort, my all. I have lived with you so long that I cannot live without you. I had rather die. Oh, remember I left my father’s house, I left all for to be with you, to be happy myself and to make you happy, and I cannot (it useless for me to conceal it longer) be happy without you. Then come home in the spring and let us resolve to spend the remainder of our days in content, though we should be poor and struggle no longer against God’s decree—for I some times think that God has so decreed that all should not be rich in this world’s goods.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I for my part have learned a lesson and you may rest assured should you ever see me again you will see me content to be with you where ever you may think fit to take me, for </span><span class="s1">I am resolved never again on this earth to make such a sacrifice for money or ever murmur again while I have you with me and have the necessary of life. I am ready and </span>willing to go any where or do anything you may wish, just so you will let me be with you. We have been happy together and I, for one, will be happier than I ever was and am determined to be so the remainder of my life as long as you are spared  to me, come what will. We have stemmed the current of life together so far. Then why should we deprive ourselves of the comfort of each other’s society when death will so soon separate us. Any how, let us return to live together until God calls one of us away.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I will make no more such sacrifices for there is no comfort in it any way, but let us go together cheerful and lighthearted east, west, north or south</span>—where in you may think proper we can, if we resolve to do so, make our home a paradise any where we prefer to have that home. Oh will I ever have the pleasure of seeing that eye sparkle and hear <span class="s1">those dear lips say “wife” again. You know you used to always call me “wife” for everything. I imagine almost some times that I can hear you say “wife.” Oh it will make my bust leap with joy to hear that sweet word from your lips once more. “Wife</span>—” Oh come and close me in your arms once more and let the first word be “Wife—”</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My darling this will be a short letter. Please answer it as soon as you get it, for I shall be all anxiety to hear my doom</span><span class="s2">—</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Osbournes have come, yet the old woman got a letter last week saying they would not come until spring. They have been saying for two years that they were coming every spring and every fall. It is too bad on the poor old woman. If they are not making anything, why not come home for her sake? If they have made, they ought to come. She has been and is at<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>this time very sick. If they do not come soon I do not think they will see her, for she looks to me like she has grieved herself to death, and no wonder, for I know if you and John were to treat me as they do her it would kill me. It will be five years next spring since they left</span>—<span class="s1">but I know you never will. I want you to exercise </span>your own judgement and do whatever you think is most expedient—but write to me and let me know what that is. You have never said a word in any of your letters about coming home. I have thought it was your intention to come next spring. I only guess at it. My feelings will sometimes get the upper hand of reason, though I constantly try to let reason rule me instead of feeling. I rely on you to do for the best and not on my own weak judgement and feelings.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I got a letter yesterday from Dave. He says<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>he is getting well and has built him a room at Dave Lloyd’s to study law in. He says he would not be surprised if he should complete the study of the law right there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Betsy Crumbaugh told me the other day that she heard somehow through the Graneses at Lexington that W.G. Haun was entirely broke again. I know no more than that, whether it is so or not, but one thing I do know: if he is broke he will try very hard to get in or get you to help him out. For the sake of our own child and yourself, to say nothing about me, keep aloof from all of them. What in Gods name has any one of them, or all of them together, ever done for you? Nothing but press you as much as they can</span>—I drop this hint to you in case you should be appealed to for assistance.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I must now bring my letter to a close. I hate to say goodbye but I must again. I wonder how much more I will have to say it to you. I hope not often. Whenever I dream of you I feel miserable for two or three days, it makes me so anxious to see you. I feel like every day is a week. Lizzie wrote you a little letter not long since. Tell John he must bring me some pretty corral when he comes and other curiosities from the sea that he can get without much trouble. Farewell! I remain your devoted and loyal wife until death, </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Martha Haun</span></p>
