Georgetown April the 2cd 1853

My Dear husband--

I set down this sunday
knight after coming from church, to commence
a letter to you I do not expect to finish it to
knight-- we are all in good health at this
time-- betty has not been confined yet I am almost
out of patience waiting on her--- the connexions &amp; friends
are all well.. &amp; all of the negroes.. I will try &amp; give
you an account of the proceedings of the church in
B W Finnell &amp; Shepards trial.. you know
they had appointed a commitee of ten to investigate
&amp; settle the difficulty. they were nearly three days
investigating the matter &amp; making out a report
after the congregation was dismissed last sunday
he requested the members to remain he then asked
if the report should be read the committee said
yes &amp; their report was that Shepard had acted
in a way calculated to deceiv Finnell. Shepard
told Finnell that he would see him at 4 o clo
in the evening, to let him have a negro man
&amp; some land on Eagle to pay the det he owed
him &amp; in an hour after telling F that he
went to Howard Smitt &amp; Robinson &amp; made
a deel trust &amp; put all of his property out of
his hands Shepard acnolledged to the com
mittee that he had no intintion of doing what
he told F he would do but told him this
to get clear of him.. &amp; of course the committee condem
ed that in him after brother Smith read the
report on Sunday last Shepard seemed to be
verry angry &amp; said the report was false &amp; said
a great many things to hurt the feelings of the
committee &amp; brother Smith also he was verry
severe on him. they did not put it to vote that
day whether or not the church would receive the
repot of the committee but appointed last
friday to settle it the members were all
there-- &amp; Jeffy got up &amp; laid the whole
matter before the church all the business trans
action of his &amp; Finell the church them
novted &amp; received the report, then Jeffy
got verry angry &amp; with drew him &amp; his
wife from the church. I do not think there
was three members on his side it is my opinions
with some others that he was determined that
the fuss between him &amp; F should get him out
for he knew if that had been setled amicably
the matter of his child would have been brough
t up next &amp; I think he could not stand that
Jef had B J Thompson D H Smitt &amp; B Glass
testimony taken in the church, but it owuld
nota ll do him any good, he is now out of hte
church, -----
