Mr Haun,

Dear xxxx, (imagine the word)

Now, don’t scold or think I am getting negligent about writing to you, for such is not the case. The reason I am writing to you with a lead pencil is because it is ten o’clock and after, and I am now in bed writing. Consequently I cannot manage ink and pen nimbly. I intended to write to you tonight but was deterred by a beau. The same occurred last week on the night I set apart to write to you, and by the same gentleman too. You had better look out. He is in the grocery business and has recently bought a dwelling house, and to sum up, is a marrying man. You had better make sure of that red headed sweetheart. Now, I am telling you that but I don’t wish it.

You just ought to have been here to have helped me eat persimmons. I had such a nice box of them sent to me. Dick and I were going to go persimmon hunting last Saturday but his pa was taken very sick and we could not go. The pastor went and had lots of fun. All went on horse back.

Cousin Fannie says she is your friend and says when you get ready to make us another visit that she has a horse to keep yours company, and also plenty of corn on hand.
I am getting homesick and want to come home but C. F. says she is not ready for me to come home yet, and so I shall not go home. I don't know when I can get off from here.
You want me to complete sentences? Well just wait till you come over, and I will study about it. When were you up at my home? Oh I want to see you so bad, but I don't believe you would believe the half of it, do you, tease?

I am getting so sleepy but if I close up this letter after not writing last week, you will say well, well, such is the changeableness of woman. I was disappointed myself at not getting to write to you, and you being disappointed for your know doing such is foreign to my nature.

Write very soon, and give me all the news. I dreamed I received a letter from you, and you scolded me in good fashion about something. I shan't say what—ain’t I mean? By the way give my love to that red headed sweetheart and tell her she does not think half as much of you as I do, and you can also tell her you do not think half as much of her as you do of me. The lovely gracious appreciation in the highest degree. I declare, I am going to sleep over this. I hope it will not disturb your slumber as it does mine or it will not fulfill the mission I design it to. My, don’t you think I make a great fuss about writing to you. Well the reason is this: I had a great deal rather see you, and talk to you than to be a scrawling this way.

Write soon.

As ever the same,

Mollie C.B.

P.S. The first thing you will think when you see this is a Philadelphia lawyer is near.
