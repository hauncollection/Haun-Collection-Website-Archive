hats keep to much noise to think of attempting
writing near them. It is a very pretty day quite

I shall attend and look for you and me too
as you use to attend them, about half of
the coledge and Mr Farmans Girls as renal
ever spring, I donot rember whether I told you
of John Roaches death in my last or not

Gabbie’s infare, never had more fun in
all my life, had the prettiest set table I
have see for a long time, such as Mrs F__ in
her exquisite task alone knows how to set loaded
with all rare delicaces, and abundance of musick Gabbie
looked as sweet as a peach. Billie as though
over cloud has a silve lineing He told me
that he thought he had acompleshed wonders
in getting Minnie. Barnie &amp; Jennie are also
united in the holy bonds of Wedlock. I was
invited to attend. but it being in the

May day associated with friends and

the full import of those two little words
{At Home} as you have been one of the many
