<strong>Thursday 1</strong> - Fine weather. Got gold today $34.50.

<strong>Friday 2</strong> - We were nearly all day ground sluicing, washing off the top dirt that has no gold in it.[note]In ground sluicing, the miners would dig a trench and place a sluice at one end, then divert a small amount of running water through the channel, either from a flume, or by diverting a part of a creek. The miners would then stand at the edges of the trench, using their picks to looses the soil along the sides, allowing the flowing water to carry it into the sluice below.[/note] Got gold $2.50.

<strong>Saturday 3</strong> - Fine weather. Got gold today $23.

<strong>Sunday 4</strong> - Very pleasant indeed. We go about with cotton and flannel shirts on, pants and no drawers, and comfortable at that. There is some snow yet in spots. Off a few miles it is quite deep.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">It commenced raining this afternoon, but very moderately. I finished my bathing box this evening. Wouldn’t I like to see you bathe in my new box? O, yes. Last night I washed a shirt, a pair of socks and then washed myself.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I sat down before the fire an hour and thought--are we so far apart? I sometimes think that you are on your way from Marysville up into these mountains. Why do I keep thinking so. O, foolish thoughts.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">John went down to the Point and mailed a letter to his ma. I read the testament of late a good deal. I scarcely see a newspaper.</span></span></span>

<strong>Monday 5</strong> - Cloudy got gold today $23.00.

<strong>Tuesday 6</strong> - Clear and pleasant. Gold today $11.00.

<strong>Wednesday 7</strong> - I went over to the American Valley to prospect and stayed until Sunday the 11th. I started home. I and John met on the road as we came to our cabin. I did not succeed in finding a good prospect.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">It was quite foggy at the valley and rainy. They got no gold today---</span>

<strong>Thursday 8</strong> - Got gold today $1.00.

<strong>Friday 9</strong> - Got gold today $9.00. Rained this evening and changed to snow.

<strong>Saturday 10</strong> - Snowing off and on all day, no work done.

<strong>Sunday 11</strong> - Fine day. No snow in the valley but the mountains around is covered, even the green trees is made white.

<strong>Monday 12</strong> - The coldest night we’ve had last night. Was cloudy all day. Seven of us got gold today $12.50, but three of the seven is sinking a hole and was at it all last week. It is 20 feet deep, 5 feet wide, dirt on top the rest is rotten through with round boulders and rock. The water comes in quite fast, but we want to see the bedrock and see if there ain’t gold there. John’s birthday was Sunday the 11th. We had nothing extra on the occasion. Snow six inches deep Tuesday morning.

<strong>Tuesday 13</strong> - Got gold today $5.00.

<strong>Wednesday 14</strong> - Got gold today $5. Somewhat cool.

<strong>Thursday 15</strong> - Got gold today $1. Quite cool.

<strong>Friday 16</strong> - Froze up the water in the ditch.

<strong>Saturday 17</strong> - Still cold of nights, and mornings no water to wash with. All hands a-prospecting but me. I am making pick handles.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Washed out the square box at the spring. Got gold $__. The men in the other cabin had a big fuss among themselves, whiskey is the cause. Not settled yet.</span>

<strong>Sunday 18</strong> - John Dobson came over to my cabin and brought his provisions.

<strong>Monday 19</strong> - Nothing done. All in confusion.

<strong>Tuesday 20</strong> - Snowed all night and today one foot deep.

<strong>Wednesday 21</strong> - Can’t work, water is froze up.

<strong>Thursday 22</strong> - Beautiful weather overhead, the snow is settled down some.

<strong>Friday 23</strong> - Dobson and I went down to the Point. No letters yet for me. What can the matter be?
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I paid Thompson $75.00 and we got $8.75 worth of fresh meat and little notions for a Christmas dinner. I got a new red flannel shirt.</span>

<strong>Saturday 24</strong> - Dobson and John set to and made a lot of mince pies for a start.

<strong>Sunday 25</strong> - Up before day as usual and caught the boys in a Christmas gift all right. I hauled on my new red shirt. Ate breakfast and then the Johns to making peach pies and plum puddings for dinner, all to our three selves. It snowed on Friday night and Saturday six inches deep on the top of what was on the ground.

<strong>Monday 26</strong> - Quite cool today. We cannot work, our ditch is froze dry. We were all day sewing. I lined my casinette pants outside in front with cotton and put a big patch on the seat of the same. Covered the bottom of my socks with cotton and made me a pair of mittens out of the legs of John’s blue pants.

<strong>Tuesday 27</strong> - Quite pleasant today, and warm. We three went prospecting, did not get down.

<strong>Wednesday 28</strong> - We went a-prospecting and did not as much as get the color. Warm and cloudy. Commend snowing this evening.

<strong>Thursday 29</strong> - Continued our prospecting from Tuesday.

<strong>Friday 30</strong> - Sunk a hole on the creek in back of the cabin, pitching bedrock.

<strong>Saturday 31</strong> - Washed several pans, got better as we went uphill. We knocked off before night. Ate dinner and John washed three shirts and three pairs of socks for him and me. We’ve had nothing to do with the men in the other cabin since the fuss. One of them told me that they were building a cabin up Nelson Creek and were going to move their provisions as soon as they could. I suppose we will have these diggings all to our three selves.
