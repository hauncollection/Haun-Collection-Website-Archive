<strong>Saturday 1</strong> - We went out to diggins. I made a riffle. We reset the boxes and put another in. While we were fixing the boxes some three new miners came to us. They wanted to work for hire or dig for themselves. So, I let William Davenport sit in as a partner. We cleaned up at noon. We got gold about $15.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I fixed up and started for the American Valley. I wore a pair of gun slippers so as not to have to carry another pair of boots back. By so doing I blistered my feet. I arrived in good time. My wife was at the old house yet, but fixing to go to the tavern to eat supper. We soon did so and took up our lodgings there also.</span>

<strong>Sunday 2</strong> - All seems to be going on in the same way, but I am at a loss living at the American Hotel as my wife is proprietress, and our house locked up looks rather deserted. I am made to feel very sad on account of poverty. Will it never alter in my time? I’ve moved often enough.

<strong>Monday 3</strong> - My wife is very busy getting dinner for the public, as the grand jury is coming in town. At noon the bell was rung. Quite a number was to dine.

P.M. I handed in my report as overseer of road section number 13 and also my resignation from that post of honor. I collected $12 more in road tax and levies, minus $18. I settled with Tom Carter. He wants to call it even.

<strong>Tuesday 4</strong> - Breakfast over, I got ready, shouldered a sack full of one thing and another—a hoe, my rifle and shot pouch, and powder horn, and my old hickory cane—and set out a foot for my diggins. I arrived there at noon after having stopped on the road from Illinois Ranch to my cabin, it being 6 miles less 300 yards. The boys were getting dinner. It over, we went out to work and got gold, some $10 or $12.

<strong>Wednesday 5</strong> - I and Mac is alone. We were out in good time. We cleaned up the rest of the boxes, and turned a head of water into another. We was cleaning up bedrock the rest of the day. Got some 2 ounces of gold I suppose, much to the pleasure of Mac.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Before noon our William came to the cabin and got his kit and wardrobe and left  without letting us know about it. After supper I gave my check shirt a cold water rinse and hung out to dry.</span>

<strong>Thursday 6</strong> - Mac was mining all day. I went up Nelson Creek and bought some hose and pipe. I gave $20 for it, and I sold what dust I had on hand. It amounted to $82. I also got 40 yards canvas at 65 cents per yard, some beeswax, needles and a palm to sew with. I got to the cabin in the afternoon. I went out to help Mac clean up. We got some $20 in dust, as near as I can guess.

<strong>Friday 7</strong> - Mac went down to the Point, got 12 pounds beef and a bottle of ground pepper,  returned, and went to mining. I was making a hose today. Later I went out and helped Mac clean up two boxes and got gold, I guess, about $8. Jake Jourdon came to see if I would let him work with us. I agreed to it.

<strong>Saturday 8</strong> - Early in the morning Jake was up with his pick and shovel, so we concluded to repair the chimney. Mac and Jake went at it. I was sewing on hose.

P.M. Mac started for the valley and still later John came over on a horse after me. I concluded to go over and left Jake to take care of the cabin, &amp;c.

<strong>Sunday 9</strong> - All’s well. My wife is getting along as well as could be expected. She dislikes to be a lone, or without me. It can’t be helped.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">The grand jury closed its session last night at 10:00 P.M., and at about 2:00 P.M. I, Mac and Bill Mackmanaway started for the cabin. We were there before sun down and had supper. Then the two Macs went down to the Point to get some blankets. Bill and I ran some bullets for my revolver, as there is a good deal of excitement about the Indians of late out at Honey Lake. [note]<em>The Plumas Argus</em> of April 29 1858 hinted at brewing tensions at Honey Lake, "For some weeks past the Indians of this country, and particularly at Indian and Honey Lake Valley have been exhibiting an insolent and insubordinate disposition, finding its expression in threats to destroy on an early day the lives of the white inhabitants of the localities mentioned, and in depredations upon the stock and other property in their reach. These threats had attracted the attention of the citizens who were consequently watchful of their movements. It is known that emissaries had visited all the scattered remnants of tribes in this and the surrounding counties, and that, as it were by a common impulse all betook themselves to Honey Lake, carrying with them everything they possessed. We have heard of at least one thousand passing near this place <em>en route</em> for that region.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">At Indian Valley great alarm was created in the minds of the inhabitants, who hastily threw up a Block House near Ward's Ranch. At Honey Lake the belief is universal that there will be a conflict. Already they have driven off a considerable quantity of stock. What adds to the feeling of fear, is that the inhabitants of this boarder region are almost entirely destitute of weapons, the guns belonging to the Plumas Rangers being worthless at the present for the want of caps. The Pitt River and Pi-ute Indians have not been in Honey Lake for some time. When they left it was with the threat to return in a short time for a fight. On all sides a conflict with these savages is universally feared and expected. We understand that the Plumas Rangers will go to Honey Lake to protect the settlers. We sincerely hope that nothing may come of these suspicious appearances, but we fear the contrary.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We can not imagine why these savages are not on the Reservations. Had it not been for the unwise assertion of some of the inhabitants of Honey Lake, that they were in Utah, we have every reason to believe that Genl. Clark would have established a military post at that place, but as his Department only extends to the California line he would do nothing. We hope that he may do so yet, for the objection mentioned should not obtain, as in fact a large portion, if not the whole of Honey Lake Valley is undoubtedly in California."
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">A few days later, <em> <a href="http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=DAC18580513.2.4&amp;e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN-------#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daily Alta California </a></em>of May 13 1858 provided an update: "One Garlow, who came down yesterday from the Big Meadows, informs us that on Thursday last, the news was brought to Brown's house by a Deputy Sheriff of Plumas county, of a fight which had taken place between a party of residents of Honey Lake and some Mormon emigrants on one side, and a party of Pitt River Indians on the other. It seems that the Mormons, who were on their way from Oregon to Salt Lake, had been robbed of their cattle by Indians, who subsequently offered to exchange he cattle for flour. This proposition was acceded to; but when once the rascally red skins had obtained the possession of the flour, they refused to give up the cattle. Pending the parley that followed this treacherous act, a party from Honey Lake, who were in pursuit of cattle which had been stolen, joined the Mormons, and made battle with the Indians. The fight lasted for two or three hours, and resulted in the death of twenty Indians and the wounding of two whites. The Mormons recovered all their cattle, and the Honey Lake party found more than enough in the possession of the Indians to make up their losses. The conquerors scalped their slaughtered foes and returned in triumph to Honey Lake. Garlow was unable to learn the number of whites and Indians engaged in the conflict or the condition of the wounded men. The Indians, who were of the Pitt river tribe, were all armed with guns. Much apprehension is felt among the residents about Honey Lake Valley, and a general uprising of the Indians is feared. Those who have heretofore lived about the white settlements have all gone away, providing themselves with ammunition before their departure.—Butte Record, May 10th"[/note]and thereabouts.</span></span></span></span>

<strong>Wednesday 19</strong> - We took some rags up the ditch to caulk the flume and threw out the rocks and shoveled out the dirt in places. By noon we had the water running down again and Jake helped the water in the ditch to bring the sluice box down to the diggins, but it was raining too hard. So, we left off and went to cabin and got dinner. We all stayed in as it continued to rain in the evening.
