Miss Mollie, my dearest friend,

This is Sunday and according to promise I write you a few lines. It is a gloomy looking day here with a little rain. I went to your house after getting home last Sunday evening and stayed until your ma came home from church. Pa, ma and myself, and also sister Dora had quite a pleasant chat. When I left Dora followed me to the door, I suppose for pity’s sake to remind me as much as possible of you and asked me if I would not come over again soon, but I told her nary a time once.

John S. was married Thursday morning before 4:00 and started off. He got home last night about 8:00 and said he saw you as he passed Mr Renshaw’s. He looked too gay. He stopped at Will Sherritt’s and was serenaded by vocalists. He says he would not be single again for any amount and advises all old bachelors to marry forthwith, for its a good thing, but probably the bad part is to come yet.

I went down to call on Mrs Jenkins Friday night and found her in bed. I told her I had seen at last what I wanted to see and that was her with her night cap on her head and not her heel. Fannie came to the door and sat with her till half past nine when Charles came in. Bob White also arrived with a wife. I have not seen her as yet but understand she has a pretty red head and is cross eyed. Would you not like to see her? I would. Bob invited me up to dine today but I excused myself. Jack Clark gave a birthday supper last week, he being 50 years old and I understood had everything nice to eat and drink and such to be merry upon. I have no news of interest to write you. Mat is drinking again some. You had better come back and get him to quit. He will quite for your sake if for no one else’s.

Love, I want to see you so much. You took snap judgement on me when I left, just snatched me in and kissed me before I knew what I was about. Mollie, you should not treat me so. I want you to see all the fun you can while you are there but don’t fall in love with some fellow over there. If you do I will go and see a widow sure before you get back.

I suppose you will allow me to visit the girls while you are away. I was at Aunt Ell’s, Mrs Lemons and your house this evening. Frank was there also making love to Dora, I believe. Your ma asked me if I had any news from Midway[note]Consult the <a title="Map" href="www.hauncollection.org/version-3/map/">map</a> for precise location.[/note] but I told her no. Dora did not believe me. They take it for granted you will write to me if no one else, but how they are mistaken ain’t they.

I wish I had something new to write you. I had lots of fun with Dora and Dinks this evening. I am going to have some fun, too, while you are away. I do not know how to spend my Sundays while you are gone. I have not you to talk to and cheer my drooping spirits. Will Crumbaugh was in yesterday and made many inquiries about you and when you were coming back but I told him four or five weeks at the least. Bob Small starts to the river tomorrow for more goods.

Mollie, I will close for the present, having nothing more to write. Tell me when you expect to come  and how, and how are getting along. Please don’t let anyone see this, not even Cliff. Write as soon as you can. Think how I would like to have one sweet kiss. Bless your sweet lips. Goodbye love and take care of yourself.

Your devoted lover till death,

J.J.H.
