March the 21st 1843

Dear husband,

I have this moment received
your second letter, I was truly glad to hear of
your good health &amp; spirits, also the rest of the
connexions, my self and family are well, we are
at Dr McClarths I will make this place my home
until your return, we have had the coldest weather
since you left I have ever seen in the South, on
the 24th of this month, we there was snow fell 11
inches deep, this morning was a little pleasant for
the first one we have had in a long while, we
have began to think something a bout Millers
prediction, the unusual weather the large comet
the srainging starts the lunar rainbow RC
have put us to thinking-- my dear hsuband
I have but verry little news to write you having
written all a bout our business in my last
letter, I think we have done as well or better
with all business as I expected, Mc has sold
all the wood at one dollar &amp; two bits a cord--
and says he will have every dollar of your money
for you by the time you come down, I have
not been to a notary public yet, on account of the
weather but will go this week, Mrs Bedford
will send up for me to morrow, and I will
go before I return to town, Dr McClreeth is verry
much of a Gentleman, the more I am acquainted
with him the better I like him, him &amp; the family
are verry kind to me &amp; John, I could not be
treated better in my own Mothers house, but
my dear I am getting verry anxious to see you
do come down as soon as you can, your dar little
boy wants to see you two, he is out this evening
with the Gentleman a shooting birds--
I do feel so anxious to get up there &amp; get
setled once more, that I do hope you will not
let me wait for you any longer than is actu
ally nessarry, I will close, give my love to my
dear old Mother &amp; sister Jane and tell them they
donot know what a pleasure it is to me to know
that I will soon be near them, give my love to
your Brothers &amp; sisters, &amp; all inquiring friends
and remember that my fond heart will ever
remain the same to you until it ceases to throub
in this bosom, farwell my best beloved
let me intreat you once more to come to me as
soon as possible, remember your loving,
Martha Haun
