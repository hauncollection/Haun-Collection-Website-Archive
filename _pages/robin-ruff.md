Robin Ruff

The best wish you could have, take
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">my word Robin Ruff,
twould scarce find you in bread or in
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">beer;
be honest and be true and say what
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">would you  do,
If you had but a thousand a year?</span></span></span>

But its when you are aged and gray,
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Robin Ruff,
and the  day of your death it draws nigh,
say what with your pain would you
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">do  with your gain
if you had but a  thousand a year?</span></span>

There’s a place that is better than this
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Robbin Ruff
and I hope in my heart  you may go there
where the poor man's  as great though he
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">had no estate
Aye,  as if he had but a thousand a year .</span></span>

Robin Ruff, if you had a but a thousand a year!
