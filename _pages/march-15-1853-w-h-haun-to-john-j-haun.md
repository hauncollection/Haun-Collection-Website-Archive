My Dear Jim,

I am in receipt of yours from Georgetown enclosing your out with the estate of E.M. Haun which I suppose is all O.K. I regret that you did not settle the draft for 500 dollars before you left. I am in rather a tight place with regard to this transition. Saul Millikin has a mortgage to secure the money I got of him, including the debt owed from you to Mary. The holders of the draft sued me last fall and now have a judgement against me for the amount. I have been begging off for some time, being in hopes that you would be able to pay me. I have no other alternative than to pay the debt when property sacrificed. The holders will wait no longer than the 1st of May next, which is a hard case in connection with my other business and the heavy losses which seem to await me. After having been to the expense of at least 1000 dollars in the building of the walls for my flour mill I am compelled to tear the whole of it down and make another foundation, and entirely change the building from a brick to a frame in consequence of the foundation giving way under one of the walls—besides old debts and present engagements. You see that I cannot do without it and shall expect you to remit it as soon as possible.

I will leave in a few days for the East for my spring stock of goods. My bills are coming due for those bought last fall and must be met. We are making money, but not as fast as it is needed and not enough to pay old debts. Every man is crowing that W.G. Haun and company owe a dollar to that is due.

Sanford has just returned from California with about 20 dollars. This, however, is a guess, but it is certain he has but little after loosing a year’s time and 300 or 400 dollars of an out lay.

Without some great drawback I will get the grist mill finished this summer and I think I will have a good one at a cost of about 9000 dollars which would at this time be good paying property. Flour is 425/100 dollar per pound and hard to get at that. All kinds of property is high. I sold today the smallest pair of four-year-old steers in a lot of nearly 100 for 70 dollars and can get 3 cents per pound for all that. I have line weight at home. Land is increasing 100 percent per anum at least for the last year. This county is the banner county in Iowa having entered 64,000 acres of land last year which is more than any other in the stock and presume at least as much more will be taken this year. I would not be surprised to know that one hundred thousand acres was taken this year. I may return through Kentucky from the East for the purpose of getting some fine cattle. I sold my bull, a cow and a calf for 300 dollars a few days since and intend to raise some more of the same kind. Common prairie cows are worth 30 dollars, Park[note]Also known as White Park or Ancient White Park, Park cattle are a rare and ancient breed of white cows originating in Great Brittain. Through now considered exclusively beef cattle, they were also used for milk and as draught animals during this period.[/note] 10 cents (miss) and everything else in proportion.

Manny had a boy on 23rd January and Tom one about 7 weeks before that time. Several women in this section have had from one to three boys, and one Sal had two without marrying at all. So you see the country is improving in every way.

If I can keep soul and body together a year or two longer the increase in the value of real estate will make me all I want—but it is a hard row to hoe. $500 in California is not
much and here it is a file so remember it and send me a draft for the amount. It may be [torn] point with me.

Your Brother,
W. G. Haun
