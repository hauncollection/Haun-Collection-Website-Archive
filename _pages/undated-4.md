but notwith standing all this- I would not
have you come home- until you are are convinced
you can do nothing there- for you I know have
under gone so many privations &amp; hardships, that
I want you now to stay until you make some
thing- &amp; if you want me or think it would be
best for me to go- all you have to do is say so
you know I have ever been willing to do what ever
you thought was for the best----- my prescious
child advised me in his last letter to stay where
I was- oh how my heart ached to read that dear
letter &amp; hear a boy of ninteen reason &amp; talk like a
man of forty that had gone through trials &amp; diffi
cultys- oh how proud I feel of him &amp; yet how
sorry to know in his tender years he must be de
prived of Society &amp; all the indearments o home--
but I do hope it will not crush his spirits but
he a profit to him in the end- oh Pa be
kind &amp; tender to him for my sake as well as
his own- for we have as much reason to love
&amp; be proud of our child as any one I ever
saw-- John says you have just got in to
the ways of the country- that you were verry
green at first- which I expected you would be
you must write to me often &amp; when ever you
start home- come the quickest way &amp; do not
think of coming by land- though you are the
best Judge of that-- I send you a ticket gotten
up as a burlesque on the trustees--
do tell me in you next how Dave is
&amp; what he is doing &amp; Jack how is as
for NP I care nothing a bout for I think
he is an ungratiful being as ever god made
I do not want John to be a bout him or
be in his power any way whatever--
I wish I could send you a kiss but I canot
write me what your prospect are &amp; all a
bout your prescious self every way--
I would not take any a mount for your
letters. I preserve them carefully
Jane is in Lexington she told me to give her
verry bet love to you &amp; John--tell my
baby to write to me- I am determined
to write every week- from this time on &amp;
may be you will get some of them- I
must say good by for the present--
while I remain your loving wife--
