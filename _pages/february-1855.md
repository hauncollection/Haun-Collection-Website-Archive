<strong>Thursday 1</strong> - Clear and pleasant this morning. I made two pick handles. I then cut and split some dry wood. After dinner I and John split some logs for back sticks. We went up to the reservoir and shut the gate, and then down to the diggins and home, after cutting an oak stick for pick handles. Cloudy this afternoon and commenced raining at dark.

<strong>Friday 2</strong> - We fully expected a good rain and snow last night and today. It cleared off at noon, however, without rain to do any good, and no snow either. We went out to fix for mining, as there is water to answer if it will only keep from freezing so hard at night.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We commenced piping but our hose burst. We mended up and done considerable work, after all the trouble.</span>

<strong>Saturday 3 </strong>- I, John and Shaw was piping off tailing and picked up $6.50. Lawrence is stripping by himself. Lloyd has not got back from below.

<strong>Sunday 4 </strong>- After breakfast as I pulled of my hickory shirt and put on another, of Johns washing. I’d only wore it two weeks. As I was dressed up and clean, I went down to the Point. I still thought to hear from my wife. Accordingly I got a letter from her dated December 22 1854[note]This letter has been preserved and is available <a title="December 22 1854" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/version-iii-series-ii/december-22-1854-martha-haun-to-james-haun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. [/note] giving an account of somewhat of her trip to Iowa, and the big dinners, &amp;c., &amp;c. There one to John from his ma written from Iowa dated December 24 1854,[note]Not included in this collection.[/note] and giving an account of the Iowa folks. It cost $2 for the two. I was expecting to hear that she was fixing to travel to California, but, O, the disappointment, blackness, darkness, all most ready to give up in despair.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">This was one of those still delightful sunny days, warm and pleasant, as is so common. My lesson was the first chapter of Ephesians. I wrote my 17th letter to my wife.</span>

<strong>Monday 5</strong> - The hose slipped off the pipe and needed patching.We piped off tailings after it was mended. In the afternoon a pine burr run in the pipe. It took some time and hard punching to get it out. We picked up gold $7.

<strong>Tuesday 6</strong> - We was at work betimes as usual. We had just fairly got underway when our hose burst. It took me till noon to sew it up again. I sent my 17th letter to wife by Lawrance to the express office, cost 25 cents. We got gold $41.50. It was warm all day, and cloudy.

<strong>Wednesday 7</strong> - Cloudy, hailed a little at noon and later rained some. We were at work early but the hoses burst in two places. After dinner I and John took them down and carried them to the cabin to sew them over again. Later I went down to the Point to get twine. I saw Lloyd. He has got back, but is too drunk to come to the cabin. We got gold $18.

<strong>Thursday 8</strong> - Cloudy weather. It was drizzling most of the day. At one time it was mixed with snow. I was at work in the cabin sewing the hose and am not done yet. John and Shaw gold gold $32. Lawrance is doing well. Lloyd has not got home yet. I suppose he is still drunk.

<strong>Friday 9</strong> - Cloudy this morning but it cleared off, and was a beautiful, warm, sunny day. The wild geese were flying North. A yellow jacket came flying about in the cabin. Shaw and John got gold $16.50. I was in the cabin all day sewing the hose, still not done.

<strong>Saturday 10</strong> - Clear and frosty last night but clouded up this forenoon.

P.M. Commenced raining good, and alternately it would snow, and keep at it. John and Shaw got gold $29 with me to help them from the middle of the afternoon, as I finished sewing the hose. Lloyd is not at home yet

<strong>Sunday 11</strong> - Cleared off last night and froze. After doing some needle work this morning, we four went out to the diggins to see what harm was done by the rush of water. While out there we picked up $4. We cleaned out Lawrance’s boxes and went to the cabin, eat dinner and then went down to the Point.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Late in the evening a man by the name of Cook, asked me to drink with him and Vaughn. Vaughn said he did not ask Mr Haun to drink with him. I told Vaughn I did not drink with such a man as he was. He stepped forward one step and said I was a damned knave. I rose up and stepped towards him two steps. He drew a large Bowey knife and said, draw and come ahead. He was drunk and drinking. He is two cowardly to act so when sober. I felt very much like killing the rogue and doing murder. But the thought of doing what whiskey will soon do in any case, and sending Vaughn to and a just God —</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I paused and reflected. I did not come to this country to fight and pitt my life against such great odds. He has nothing to live for but to get drunk.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">This is the third time that a deadly weapon has been Pointed at me, but I was not much scared —</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I got 1 1/8 inch sole leather, $1; paper tax 25 cents.</span>

<strong>Monday 12</strong> - Cold last night and clouded up this morning. We all four was running tailings off. Lawrance’s Diggins took out no gold today.

<strong>Tuesday 13</strong> - I was making false bottoms for Hungarian Riffles. I got them made in time enough to put them in the boxes. Shaw and John was cleaning up bedrock till noon and got gold $8. After noon we were setting boxes and fixing on the hose that I mended last week.
<strong>
Wednesday 14</strong> - I, John and Shaw was mining today, washing down new dirt with hose and pipe. We took out $118, one piece weighing $53, and one $24, and one $22.50. The balance was small dust, cloudy or hazy. It commenced to rain after dark.

<strong>Thursday 15 </strong>- Did not rain much last night. Somewhat cloudy and foggy this morning, but turned out a beautiful, warm, sunny day.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We was piping away when the hose split--not the thread but the cloth, for the first time. It took me the whole evening to put on a patch. We got gold $32.50. If the hose didn’t rip ---</span>

<strong>Friday 16</strong> - Fine weather today. It is the first day that we have been able to work all day with the pipe and hose for months past. We a good head of water and nothing to break. We took out $131.50, one piece weighing 5 1/4 oz or 84$, as we count. Lloyd came home to  day with Delirium-tremens.

<strong>Saturday 17</strong> - Cool and clear. We fixed to clean up bedrock and got gold $143. This is what makes my time pass off much easier and faster than I want it to.

<strong>Sunday 18</strong> - Cold this morning. I made three Hungarian Riffles for Lawrace, and made a level. After dinner I went down to the Point and mailed a letter for John to Pauline Haun, 25 cents. I got three boxes matches, 25 cents, and hired J. Shults to fill Lloyd’s place, as I do not intend to have anything more to do with a drunkard, than I can possibly help---

<strong>Sunday 18</strong> - We had a settlement with Lawrance. He took out $67.50 in the last 14 days - we had to pay him $20 out of it for lost time. We then got $24 out of it to divide in four shares. It has been warm and pleasant today. My lesson is the 3rd Chapter of Hebrews --- I had to patch the right sleeve of my hickory shirt, before I went to bed.

<strong>Monday 19</strong> - Cool this morning, and continued to freeze all day. Cloudy, with wind from North. Some little snow fell. We cleaned up bedrock and got gold $27.50. James Shults came up and worked in Lloyd’s place with Lawrance. I am to give him $75 per month. Lawrance mended my boots tonight --- I paid Shively, the constable, $3 for going down with me to Winters Creek to serve a process and attachment and summon witnesses, but Henry Goldshall was gone.

<strong>Tuesday 20 </strong>- Cold last night. The water froze up so that we could not work. I, John, Shaw and Lawrance took five picks to the valley had three sharpened, $1.50, and two steeled, $3. Three meals and lodging at Betsy Town each, $3 for me and $6 for John.

<strong>Wednesday 21</strong> - We then took dinner at American Ranch, $1 each for I and John, and them came home before sundown. The weather is cool, and it froze considerable last night. Our water ditch is still froze up; no water to work with.

<strong>Thursday 22</strong> - I dreamed last night that my wife was with me, and that John Hurst and his son Albert had come to California.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">It was snowing a little this morning when I got up. The old snow was quite all melted off and today it is slightly covered again. We can’t work in our diggins. I went down to the Point and paid Roots and Lewis all we owed them, $13.25, as $8.50 was marked paid; $5 for John’s hat and $3.50 for whiskey. I gave Mrs Doussler $2 for an oven and lid for the company.</span>

<strong>Friday 23</strong> - Snowing this morning and continued more or less most of the day. Shaw and I had a settlement and divided out $4 in four shares. He got one and I kept three. I then paid him off 7 1/2 oz in gold dust that I had borrowed. In all, he loaned me 12 oz. I previously paid 4 1/2 oz. P.M. Shaw, Lawrance and I went down to the Point as we can’t work. Lloyd is anxious to know whether I will let him work again with us or not. I saw a son of Sam Brown’s that Cash Clay had the fight with.

<strong>Saturday 24 </strong>- Clear and cold last night. Three inches of snow on the ground. We are not doing anything like work. Warm and hazy today. I went down to the Point and learned for the first time that Adams &amp; Co. Banking Express has failed. I had two old blue shirts. I cut one up to patch the other late at night. The snow it quite all gone.

<strong>Sunday 25</strong> - Cold and clear last night but warm and cloudy today. I finished mending my shirt and read the first and second chapter of the First Epistle General of Peter. After dinner I went down to the Point. I learned from Whitney that the vigilance committee[note]The Nelson Creek vigilance committee was in being from 1853. Though not as active as other vigilante groups at the time, the committee gave a number of notices to individuals they considered undesirable. In 1854, the group tried John Baxter in the stabbing death of Peter Taffe. After acquitting Baxter, they assisted him in escaping the authorities, angering local officials. In the winter of 1854 - 55, the committee again sought to eject several undesirable individuals from the community, and in the course of their actions, laid themselves open to a charge of robbery. Around this time, February 1855, many of the most influential men in Nelson Point were indited on this charge, including James Sherwin, J.S. Roots, Ed Sterling and others. All were baled out almost immediately, except for James Sherwin, who stubbornly refused to give bonds and remained in the Quincy jail until April. (Fariss and Smith, pg. 214 - 15.)[/note] had called a meeting yesterday and added 10 more to their number, making 25 in all. They are determined to resist the civil law in the case of Captain Fagan, as the Grand Jury found a true bill against the vigilance committee three weeks since. It commenced snowing late this evening and was at it when I turned in.

<strong>Monday 26</strong> - And was at it this morning. Four of us went up the ditch to put some new timber across the ditch to hold up the covering that had been broke down by the big snow we had at Christmas time. We finished at noon. It commenced to rain and continued all evening. After dinner I and Lawrance went up again and calked the long flume. We cleaned the rocks and snow out of the ditch as we came home. The water was nearly down to the reservoir ---
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">This makes three days work done on the ditch.</span>

<strong>Tuesday 27</strong> - Cloudy and warm last night. Not much rain fell. The snow is fully half gone, about 10 or 12 inches deep. It is warm and cloudy all day without rain. The water made its way down to the diggins by 1/2 past 1:00, but not enough to work with. I, John and Shaw went up the ditch to see what was the matter. All was right, except the ground soaks up so much water.

<strong>Wednesday 28</strong> - Commenced raining last night after dark and continued all night and all day today very hard. The snow is quite gone from about here. We all went to work, except Lloyd. we got gold $2.50. Jim Shults is at work for me.
