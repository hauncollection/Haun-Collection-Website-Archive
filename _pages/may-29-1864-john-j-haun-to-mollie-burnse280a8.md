Dear Friend,

Your kind favor of the 17th[note]Not included in this collection.[/note] was received on the 24th. I was delighted to know you were in good health and that the ring had reached its destination in safety. I was fearful it would not reach you not on account of its value—but I am somewhat like the fair sex, I dislike to be disappointed even in trifling matters. You say you will not wear it until somebody’s return home. It is likely somebody may never return; you would never get to wear it according to your doctrine. However you can use your own discretion concerning it. I am pleased to know you appreciate it so highly. (I have been a prisoner ten months and expect to be ten more.)

Mary, I received a letter yesterday from my Ohio duck. What do you think of that? A Union girl. too. Now if you will treat me right clever and write to me often perhaps I will let you see her letters. I know you would like to see them wouldn’t you? The correspondence commenced in rather a singular way by my writing letters for a prisoner to her, a mess mate of mine who was left at her father’s house wounded for a short time. I never saw her but I think she is a nice girl. She says she hopes I will not go into the Rebel army again. She wishes to send me something to read if I will accept it— but I will bet she is not half so pretty or fascinating as somebody I know. She is well educated judging from the letters she writes.

I was not aware I had a grandma living. If I have, I was somewhat surprised to find such an elderly lady wearing rings, but tell grandma I have not forgotten her or the pleasant little chat we had on the steps one evening. Is your uncle Will at home or not? I suppose all the town boys have been drafted or left home so the girls are without beau for the present. Is H.H.W. still in town, and what are you doing?

You are a little selfish, sure enough. You can do silly things whenever you please, but I must not dwell I suppose. I will have to submit to you as I generally do. The old song says it is the devil’s hell on earth for a woman to wear the breeches. Be careful or I will have to don a certain kind of apparel I once spoke of in a letter to you. I know you do not wish to exchange with me just yet.

Is it Tom Barkley’s daughter that is going to marry Mr Wells? I thought she was but a child yet, too young to marry. Tell me where the Wells are from. They must be worth catching, marrying so soon after coming to town. I must close for the present. Mary write soon and give me all the news. My respects to Tom L. and best love to Chalk.[note]John occasionally refers to Mollie teasingly by her middle name, Chalk.[/note] while I remain truly your friend. Love to Dora.

J.J.H.
