<strong>Monday 5</strong> - John hauled 925 pounds wheat to Burkholder at $5.50 per pound, and brought back some slats to make a pole fence. I cut and split 1 cord wood for Newton. Late in the P.M. I and John staked and rigged up a log fence.

<strong>Thursday 15</strong> - John and Truit took another load of lumber to Badger Hill. I and Mc finished the paling and did some other things.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">After dark we had a meeting in the courthouse to pass resolutions to sustain Douglass in his course against the Lecompton, Kansas swindle,[note]Drafted at Lecompton, Kansas in 1857, the Lecompton Constitution was one of four proposed constitutions for the state of Kansas. It would have made Kansas a slave state. The proposal was called into question for several reasons.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">First, the delegates who drafted the document represented only a small portion of the population of the Kansas territory, and the selection of delegates was heavily biased in favor of proponents of slavery. Secondly, residents of Kansas territory were not given an opportunity to vote for or against the constitution as whole. Instead, a referendum was held in which voters were given a choice between two alternative solutions to the slavery question: one was unabashedly pro-slavery, the other, misleadingly labeled as "no slavery," restricted the import of new slaves but protected existing slaveholders in the state. In either case, slavery would exist in Kansas; it was merely a question of the extent. As a result, many Free-Soil antislavery voters boycotted the polls, and the slavery version was approved.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Lecompton was strongly supported by the Democrat President Buchanan and the main party. A contingency of Northern Democrats lead by Stephen Douglas broke with the party to oppose it on the grounds that the drafting and voting process was fraudulent, and in opposition to popular sovereignty. The controversy was as this time popularly known as the 'Lecompton Swindle.'
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">In 1858 an election was held in which, not merely the slavery clauses, but the whole Lecompton Constitution was submitted to popular vote and decisively overturned. Kansas joined the union as a free state in 1861.[/note] but it was no go. I paid the express $3.25 for services and $2.25 to Bass and Houk on settlement.</span></span></span></span>

<strong>Friday 16</strong> - The day is warm and pleasant, though somewhat cloudy. Nothing doing. Coffin got 500 pounds cabbage. In the P.M. John and Mac loaded on hay for G. Apple.

<strong>Saturday 17</strong> - It has been several days since I wrote down any transactions, but I was around town as usual.

<strong>Sunday 18</strong> - May God help us. We are in a bad fix and see no way to get out of it. We are to be as poor as the poorest, duns from all quarters, and nothing to pay with but the ranch.

<strong>Monday 19</strong> - I was helping Maston to fix three picks, cost $1.50 each, in all $4.50. In the P.M. I had him make a claw to draw nails with. I gave $2 for it. John and Mac was fixing the fence down the lane till noon. After they hauled wood for Maston, two loads wood, four cords, for a total of $6.

<strong>Tuesday 20</strong> - Early. Watpain came with two pack mules form Coffins to take our grub and tools to the mines at Willow Ranch. Mac and I set out after a short embrace of my wife. My blankets and some of my clothing was on hand. It has been two years since, on the 10th of last March, we all left the same place to live in the American Valley—but what a change! Lizzy has ran off and got married. Dave is gone to Marysville, and John is low spirited with his mother on the ranch. She too, O God, is very unhappy. I left her weeping —
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We arrived at the cabin about about noon. We found the camp occupied by two poor dirty miners. We unpacked the mules then took out some provisions that my wife had prepared for us before we left and sat down out of doors to eat. Then we cleaned out the cabin and the area in front, and put our things in. We then went out where these men were mining and saw them clean up. They had $9.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I spread my blankets on a very narrow bedstead and woke up very cold in the night. I got another pair of blankets and tried it again, but with no better success —</span>

<strong>Wednesday 21</strong> - I and Mac went down to Rocky Bar and dined with Kyler and company. After, he gave us cups and saucers, knives and spoons, two fry pans and a skillet. We put out for home. At Nelson Point we got $10.50 worth more grub and tools. So, we put for the cabin with our  packs, we took supper as our cooked provisions was not all gone yet.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I changed my bed Wednesday night and slept somewhat better, though I dreamed that John Hurst had came to this country to see after his daughter. Lizzy he seemed very much dissatisfied about him.</span>

<strong>Thursday 22</strong> - As we do no cooking breakfast is easy got. After, we started up the ditch to see if all was right. We soon found plenty of water. As we went along the ditch we cleaned it out and cut some brush out of the way that had grown up since I left it. The flume is much out of order, though plenty of water is passing still father up. It has been cut and stopped again recently, and near the head it has broke down and a sluice box has been put in by someone, but it is not large enough to carry the water so it runs over. We stopped some of the water out of the head of the ditch, went home and got diner. After we was hunting for a place to prospect. Mac made up some dough for bread as neither of us had done it.

<strong>Friday 23</strong> - We went over to the main ravine to prospect every pan. We put in the day to very little effect.

<strong>Saturday 24</strong> - Root was up here last evening and promised to be here soon this morning. We went up the ditch and left him. He overtook us. We examined some diggins at the head of the ditch to the left and found gold on the bedrock and a shovel, sluice, fork, root ax, and three of my sluice boxes. We went up the ravine, but there was too much snow to see the character of the ground, so we returned home and took dinner.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We went down to Willow Ranch then to Nelson Point and stayed till near night. We learned there of quite an excitement in Honey Lake Valley. The Indians is gathering to fight the citizens of that valley, Indian and American. They take the miners as they come to them.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We went home to cabin and as night approaches my thoughts and feelings are anything but pleasant as the distance of 10 miles separates me from my wife and John.</span>

<strong>Sunday 25</strong> - It was daylight when I awoke, after dreaming that old Charles was altering some negro boys 8 or 10 years old, as if they were so many pigs.[note]'Altering' refers to the gelding of farm animals.[/note]
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">In time we had out breakfast. Mac made up some dough for bread. We then went to to reservoir and tried two pans of dirt, but got no color. We came back to the cabin. Mac was baking bread.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">After dinner we went down to the Point stayed till the next night. I bought some beef, butter and molasses, which cost $7.50 in cash altogether, then went home. Emmonds brought four letters over from Quincy, two from Marysville, one from Georgetown, Kentucky, and one from my wife. She is about to take charge of the old American Hotel at Quincy.</span>

<strong>Monday 26</strong> - Early in the morning I and Mac shoulder our tools and went up to the reservoir to prospect. We set two sluice boxes, one with a riffle in it, turned in the water, and set to diggin. We quit early and cleaned up and got gold.

<strong>Tuesday 27</strong> - I came to the conclusion to work at another place for the present until we can get a hose. We are a going to try the channel that Dave left off in. I fixed up three old sluice boxes that was near by, set them up, and had the water running through them. We had to move a part of the rock pile that was under a large pitch pine that had been dug up by the roots.

<strong>Wednesday 28</strong> - I dreamed that my wife said some hard things to me. I said nothing in return.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Early in the morning I was making a sluice box out of some old lumber. Mac is out digging or running the top dirt off. I carried the box out.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">It commenced snowing, so we quit work and went to the cabin. We stayed inside the rest of day. I drew up some accounts. It snowed all day.</span>

<strong>Thursday 29</strong> - Very cold this morning. The ground is covered with snow and clouds from the North. I continued drawing up accounts. We took dinner and went out to ground sluicing. I repaired another old sluice box and put it in below.

<strong>Friday 30</strong> - Another beautiful morning. Mac is getting breakfast. Once over, we went to ground sluicing till noon. After we tried to clean up but the cement is so very hard that we made but little headway. At all events, we cleaned up the boxes and got about $4 for a start.
