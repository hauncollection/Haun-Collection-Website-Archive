My Dear Husband--

Georgetown April 10 1854

I set down to knight
to write you though with verry little hope
you will ever get it--but I am resolved to
write you every mail any how which is
the irst &amp; fifteenth &amp; if you do not get
a letter every mail you way rest assured it
is the fault of the mail &amp; not mine--
for I do assure you it affords me more
pleasure than any thing else in this world
to converse with you in this the only way I
have to do it. I saw your letter DH
Smith he left it with me a few days &amp;
then come &amp; got it to answer it he said he was a
going to write you a long letter. I have received
all of the letters you have written. Since you
left home. I have to knight looked over them
all &amp; oh how much I prize them you little
know. I have received seven written since you landed
in Calafornia- the last one of date Feb the
6th I got it just one week a go to day. I
wrote you by the last mail which was
the first of this month it was written
the 25th of March to give it time to get to
New  York by the first of the time the vessels
leave- in my last I told you a bout

[torn]
think Dave was sadly disappointed in H D
he found that he was for self altogether &amp; he
being sick all the time thought he had better
hunt other friends. H D is an unprincipled
dog &amp; ever was &amp; I do hop my child will
treat him with disrespect &amp; utter contempt
on his parents account for I do most cordial
ly hate him &amp; ever shal. tell my child to
nurse &amp; encourage his proud spirit for hat
will greatly help to take him through this
world &amp; not think because he isworking hard
&amp; living rough that it is in the least degrading or hum
bling to his pride no on the contrary it is
elavating &amp; ennobling to his character it should
make him feel greatly his superiority to others
who are in poverty &amp; have not the moral cour
age &amp; pride enough to try to get out of it---
this is the light all persons of worth view
these things then feel your superority to a
poor indolent low spritied class that have
not moral courage enough to make an effort to
keep from being underlands. I am truly proud
of my boy- for hard as I know his lot must
beI believe with his native pride he is happier
the way he is doing than he would be here in
idleness &amp; with out the means of doing any thing
he wanted to - tell my boy not to forget me
or to suffer his affections to be come riceaned from
me by his absence- for he is the pride &amp; delight
of my heart- &amp; to ever know that he was indiffer
ent to me would break my heart I pray god
that he will prosper you both in your lavdalile
enterprise &amp; that you may soon get to me a gain
where we can spend the balance of our days to
gather in happiness &amp; content for your &amp; I have
not a great while longer to combat the world
I think you will come home next winter at any rate
I hope you will make enough this summer to do you
some good to come home with--I stal stay
as I am this year U then if you cannot come home
I will try &amp; go to you- I have got the negroes
all hired out except but &amp; I have got the geroes
all hired out except but &amp; I have Toms Finnell
&amp; his wife boarding with me &amp; the Dentist is a
day boardes he has got those offices of Weeles
Just a bove me.. I cannot see how the geroes
would get a long with out me for I find it no sm
all job to take care &amp; manage things as they shou
ld be &amp; that two with out meanes but I
am trying to do the best I can &amp; I believe ev
ry one will give me the credit of doing the best
I can-- at any rate I do the best I know for the
credit &amp; welfare of my self &amp; family.
Old brother smith was down to see the other day to
hear from you &amp; to tell me he had got a letter
from Emma. She had got to San francisco &amp; was well

the church is in rather a luke warm condition
brother Smith preaches as sual every other Sunday---
Curtis Smith has located in Louisville his health is
bad &amp; he preaches verry seldom---the sewing so
ciety meets at my house every wednesday evening it
is pretty well attended-- there has nothing new
transpired here of late- it is the same dull monot
onous place that is used to be. tell John that
there is a talk of Will Roy &amp; am of them ugly Miss
Downeys marrying but if they do they will have to
run off for old Downy says he shalnot have her
Theodore Thornton &amp; Mary Smarr is in low with ea
ch other. Theodore went out there last week to see
her &amp; old Smarr would not let her see him----
so you see what money will do if these boys were
rich or even energetic the old men would not object
to their daughters marrying them but they want to
live high dress fine &amp; do nothing-- lizzi is going to
school &amp; is growing verry fast she sends her love to you
both tell John to write to me &amp; tell him to bring me
when he comes home some pretty bunches of corral &amp;
some of the curiositys from the sea &amp; Isthmus. Dave
brought Mrs Web some beautiful carrab in its natur
al state you must not think of coming back by land it
will take you two long you my sweet husband
bring me some curiositys from the sea &amp; isthmus---
I will bid you farewell &amp; rest assured that I will
write you every mail I wrote you a bout the West busy
ness &amp; clint sent another note in one of my letters I do home
you will get some of them yet. I sent you a good many papers
write me often &amp; come when every you can or think you ought
farewell my prescious treasures, your devoted wife until death M Haun
