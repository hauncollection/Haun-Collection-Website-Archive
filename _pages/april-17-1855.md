<p style="padding-left: 180px;">New Orleans, April 17th 1855</p>
My dear friend
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">Your kind letter should have
been replied to long since, but a press of duties pre
vented. I cannot tell you how rejoiced I was to hear
of you through Mary, who reached New Orleans a
week ago. Ms Stuart and family left the day after
their arrival, together with Ben; but I prevailed on
them to learn Mary with me for a few weeks. I have
been too happy since she came, to think of any one
almost, and have talked so much about George-
town in are almost in the humor to bundle up
and go back. I sometimes wish I could forget you
all! What is the reason we are almost invariably
doomed to be separated from those we love best on
earth? Forgive me, by precious friend, for com-
plaining where I should console. I forgot that you
were suffering the desolation of loneliness. Yet you
whose noble true hears beat ever responsive to your
own, and with whom, in the inter change of thought
and feeling, many a dark hour may be beguiled.
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">Tis a blessed thing to feel that when the
hurricane rages fiercest, there are strong and noble
saks, unshaken by the storm , in whose faithful
tranches the frightened, panting bird may find
a refuge.            We have most delightful
markets. There are millions of roses everywhere, all
the markets are teeming with luscious watermelons
“new potatoes” cabbages, and boquets; not jumbled
as U have them here, but neatly and temptingly
aranged in tidy stalls to suit the taste of
gourisand? or sentimentalist. In any little yard
pansies and rubenas are blooming beneath the
shade of arbor irtaes?, and auop? the street in
a busy, homely yard where are snugly coddled
together a little house, a hen coop and two mule
stalls-- or swaying willow trees nods to me or I took
from my s ing balcony. Every thing is spring-like
and enchanting, but I think of the last gone
spring and yearn to be again with those whose
presence was brighter to me than the sunshine
and whose tones were dearer than the voice of birds
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">Mary tells me you will come
here in the fall to embark for California. You
must come prepared to stay several weeks with
me. I anticipate so much happiness, and with
the summer time already ended.
<div style="text-indent: 15em;">Mary says I
must give you her love, and get you to say to the
homefolks that she is in a blissful state of stupidity.
She saw Kate Cozzen at Canolton the other day. All
was well.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">Write to me soon, and believe me ever</div>
<div style="text-indent: 13em;">your devoted friend</div>
