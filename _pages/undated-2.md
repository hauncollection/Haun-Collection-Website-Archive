<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My own Dear Husband,</p>

<div style="text-indent: 12em;">I last week wrote John a long
letter of three sheets of paper. I was very low spirited at the time
I wrote having been quite unwell for a week or ten days any
how I have spells of low spirits that I canot avoid I have probably
said something a bout your cold way of writing to me that I ought
to have kept to my self, if there is any thing wrong you will look
over it I endevored to write the truth exactly as I felt at the time
but I want you to do as you please a bout coming you ought to
know your own business &amp; your duty better than I can tell you-
I canot see for my life how I am to get a way from here
feel any degree of satisfaction in leaving I had much rather stay
one year or 18 months as I am &amp; for you to come home then then
for me to go out there now I got a letter from Dave yesterday
saying he would not now probably go to Cal until fall he said
he was very tired of staying there in Iowa but would have to
stand it a while longer now I want to you to write to me
when you will come as soon as you get this &amp; if you say
positively you will not come in a year or 18 months I will go
out with him though I had much rather you would come
than for me to go there-- Irwin Stevenson told me to
tell you to write him a letter he sends his best respects to you &amp;
says if you will write to him &amp; give him any encouragement he
will go out himself he says tell him if he is doing well to stay
until he has made enough to do him. I told him I would do no such
thing &amp; to hush talking that way that you ought to stay there
[torn] not to write to you com home
[torn] knows how bad I want to see you
[torn] ther from Dave saying he was
tired to [torn] ying in [torn] but had no money to come
a way he went there to get money from Sant to take
him to Cal Sant has not got it yet as soon as he gets it
he will come back here &amp; get ready to go to Cal &amp; you
must write as soon as you get this &amp; tell me if you will
come home in a year if you will not promise that I will
go out with him. So no more of this at present--
our church is in a very luke warm condition we
have John Ganes to preach for us once a month the
members seems very indifferent only when he preached
Dr Alex Keens got up here to his fathers three weeks
a go verry ill they thought he would die in Louisville
but they got him up here &amp; he lay ten days verry low &amp;
I took a notion he would go back home &amp; they could not
persuade him out of it so hey started with him &amp; got
a few miles below frankfort when he died the Drs
said he was diing when they started with him that he
was cold to his knees in death-- Wallace you know
died a bout a year a go.. the old Dr has out lined
all his childr except Mrs Elliot-- old General F
Counroy has got back to town looking like a ghost he
has been sick a long time. I wrote you all the news in
Johns letter. I told you how moore told me hence to ask
a favor of him for lizzie unless I would hive her up to
him altogether she would rather die than go to him, so
she will stick to me go where I will unless I force her
a way from me &amp; that I canot nor will
not do she is anxious to go to Cal &amp; if I go I will take
her I cant leave her nor part from her for she clings
as closely to me as if she was my own child-
&amp; she is a credit &amp; pleasure to us or ought to be for
sh is pretty &amp; smart- Dr Craig &amp; Paul Rankin
brought Bob Keens old house &amp; give it to Harrison
Rankin old Mrs Caldwell is dead. Beri Glass
has bought Levi Brewetts house at six thousand
dollars. Harvey Ganes is living in Thornton John
sons old hous until he gets another built on his for
his daughter Norah &amp; Jim Henry gets marrie soon

tavern for five years. John West is doing as he
was when you left. there is a set of them alwa
ys setting a bout the taverns Clint John &amp; J Webb
Tim Pullin Lou Adams &amp; all that set- Sam Thomp
son says he is going to move to Illinois this fall
but no one believes him. I comence a gain to knight
to find my letter &amp; the moon is shining bright through
my window &amp; the band a practicing over at the pollo hall
for to morrow the masons march to morrow &amp;
have a diner. Oh that music how it makes my hart
ache it makes me think of my poor boy &amp; times
that are past &amp; gone. lizzie says tell uncle I am kicking
up my heels in his place in bed, &amp; says I would send
him a kiss if I could oh I would die were it not
for the affection &amp; life of that child take her from me &amp; what
would I do. next week is comencement week here
&amp; there is going to be a ball here on wednesday
knight, but I feel no interest in any of these things
Far lans school is in confusion his teachers are
every one going to leave him--Bat Thompson is
boarding here &amp; doing nothing as usual Jack Thomo
son is broke up intirely &amp; gone to Mo to his wifes
sisters laziness broke him---Mr Haun I must
close my letter &amp; now let me tell you plainly I
do not want to go to Cal &amp; nothing will make me
start only to know that is the last chance for me
ever to see you &amp; my child a gain I feel that I
am getting too old to go there 7 run the risk of having
to live &amp; die in hardships &amp; privation I know my child
wont ask it of me for he has often written to me
not to think of coming &amp; I think if you will think
seriously of it you wont ask it had I of known the
morning you sarted at the end of two years absence
things would have been as they are now I would have
gone then but after having suffored all this time &amp;
at last have to go is very hard. but you will have
to do as you please my happiness is in your keeping-
you must remember. So write as soon as
you get this &amp; do not delay. give my love to
my darling boy &amp; accept the love &amp; live long attach
ment of a devoted sorrow stricken wife--
Brother Smith sends his love to you &amp; Martha [lla?]
Ann E West send her love to you &amp; says bring her a
lump of gold when you com--</div>
