Widow Machre[note]"Widow Machre" or "Widow Marchree" was a popular broadside ballad. A highly similar version printed between 1833 - 1841 is housed at the Bodleian Library. The imprint reads "Birt, Printer, 39 Great St. Andrew Street, Seven Dials, London."[/note]
Widow Machree its no wonder you frown,
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Och, hone! Widow Machree;</span>
Faith it ruins your looks that same dirty black gown
<span style="margin-left: 35px;">Och, hone! Widow Machree.</span>
How altered your air,
With that close cap you wear—
‘Tis destroying your hair
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Which should be flowing free;
Be no longer a churl
Of its black silken curl,
<span style="margin-left: 35px;">Och, hone! Widow Machree.</span>
“Widow Marchree now the summer is come,
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Och, hone! Widow Machree.</span>
When everything smiles, should a beauty look glum?
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Och, hone! Widow Machree.</span>
See the birds in pairs,
And the rabbits and hares—
Why even the bears
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Now in couples agree;
And the mute little fish,
Cant speak, though they wish
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Och, hone! Widow Machree;</span>
Widow Marchree, and when winter comes in,
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Och, hone! Widow Machree.</span>
To be poking the fire all alone is a sin,
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Och, hone! Widow Machree.</span>
Why the shovel and tongs to teach
To each other belongs
And the kettle sings songs
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Full of family glee,
While alone with your cup,
Like a hermit you’ll sup,
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Och, hone! Widow Machree.</span>
“And how do you know, with the comforts, I have told,
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Och, hone! Widow Machree;</span>
But you’re keeping some poor fellow all out in the cold
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Och, hone! Widow Machree;</span>
With such sins on your head,
Sure your peace would be fled,
Could you sleep in your bed,
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Without thinking to see,</span>
Some ghost or some sprite
That would wake you each night
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Crying, “Och, hone! Widow Machree.”</span>
Then take my advice, darling Widow Machree.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Och, hone! Widow Machree.</span>
And with my advice, why I wish you’d take me,
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Och, hone! Widow Machree,</span>
You have me to desire
Then to stir up the fire;
And sure hope is no liar
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">In whispering to me,</span>
That the ghost would depart
When you’d me near your heart
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Och, hone! Widow Machree.</span></span></span></span>
