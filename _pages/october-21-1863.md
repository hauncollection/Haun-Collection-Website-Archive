<p style="padding-left: 180px;">Prison No. 1 Barracks No 9
Camp Chase Ohio Oct 21st</p>

<div style="text-indent: 4em;">Dear Friend</div>
I Received your anxiously looked for letter on the sev
enth. I had began thinking my letter had not
reached it destination and was just on the eve of
writing another when it came. I owe you an ap
ology for such a long delay in responding. But the de
lay was unavoidable as I was taken sick shortly af
ter receiving your letter and was unable to write sonner
but I am about well again and have been m
moved to another prison as you will see from the head
ing. I never thought for a moment if you would disregard
your promise concerning your Bourbon visit. There
fore looked for this letter with more eagerness if p
ossible than any other, well you give a glowing discr
iption of your visit and things about Paris. surely time
must be getting better in Ky since the departure of so
me of her Rebellious subjects I am so truly glad to learn
you are enjoying yourself so finely if I cannot myself
so Sam L is married at last I thought that would
have taken place ere this nothing preventing but a
slight intoxication on his part as I understand. It
seems the girls are all marring for fear there will be no
one to marry when the war is over I suppose the M
isses Wills are the most fashionable and wealthy
merchants of the town, I believe the girls generaly fa
ncy murchants. I thought Mat was in Canada wit
h several others from town but it seems I have
been mistaken. I remember the name of [Coleord?]
very well but have forgotten his features. At any
rate I suppose he is a good fellow as Bachelors are gen
erally and not cross and crabbid as some people tur
m them. I saw Wallace Graves immediately after
he was killed literally torn to pieces by a shell. I
suppose Mr Graves takes it very hard losing both
of his boys with in a few months of each other. It is
truly a sad sight to see the boys brought home in such
a way. I have very good health until recently but
nothing very serious and will be well soon as you
know. I am a healer. Mollie this is truly cold gloo
my place. The reason I asked Fannie L if she knew
Mr Grimes one evning while takin my accus
tomed walk I over heard part of a letter read &amp; the
name of Miss L of G Town when I began to inqui
re and found it was Tom of course I will have to
wait until you have a wedding before I can get an
invitation. I should like very much to come hom
but my uncle Sam will not let me. I have not
forgotten the ring nor the associations connected with it
Those days will long be remembered by me as one
has said we seldom forget incidents in life that
give us a great deal of pleasure or pain just as the
case might be, you accused me of stealing when
I left home. That is pretty hard but I suppose I will
have to plead guilty before so fair an accuser
But just tell me what man is there that could
withstand such a temptation with such a deica
te morsel set before him “not I” I must conf
ess I believe my reservation would fail me on such
an occasion no matter how much I would try to
resist. But I am confident when you take an oth
er view of the case my sentence will be compara
tively light. If we ever should chance to meet
again I might commit the same offence, if I
should just punish me as my crime deserves &amp;
I will not complain. Mollie take warning of
poor Fitzsimmons when you marry and do
not whip your husband and cause him
to commit Susan Sides. I read your letter to one
of my mess mates by way of retaliation. Retaliat
ion is fair in war, you know! I recieved a letter
from S Harris a few days ago. He was well &amp; said
[Eph?] was in his me &amp; S.K. Bangs J. Shermitt and so
me others I am not acquainted iwth. I sent your
kindest regards to him, I recieved your first letter
the evening they left for Camp Douglas. Does Mat
Saunders drink as hard as he was used to. Ask
Dora how Buddie is whether he is at home or not
I have not written or received a letter from home
since I left Ky. I heard through Mrs S, West that
my partens were well, Several pictures have been
received by mail but they were badly broken. hence
the reason for my tasking you to send it. I have
finished your ring in is pronounced the neatest one
made in prison &amp; would send it in this letter but
there has been so many put in letters that have
never been received at home. If I do not meet with
an opportunity to send it by some individual soon
I will send it by mail &amp; rusk the chances of its arriv
al. (do not put off writing because I did), for you know I want to you to have it. rings have a way of getting
out of letters that leave here unless put in the especial charge

[top front]
of capt [Tiffany?] the letter deliverer. I shall commit anoth
thrift when I send you. so you can get your punishment ready
when you see me. I must close [illegible] out of space J.J.H.
