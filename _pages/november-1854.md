<strong>Sunday 5</strong> - Shaw and Lawrence went over to the American Valley early. While there, they saw a Mexican that had helped to kill three Chinamen on Friday night last. The other Mexican got away.[note]On the morning of November 1 1854 four Chinese men traveling from Elizabethtown to Marysville were attacked. Three were murdered, the fourth was wounded, but able to hide. The bodies were discovered and the authorities notified shortly after; two Mexican travelers were suspected. By the time the Mexicans rode into Quincy that evening, the sheriff was already awaiting them. Seeing the authorities, the two men fled. Bullets were exchanged, and the sheriff's horse was hit in the neck, allowing one of suspects time to escape. The other man, Jacinto Arro, was caught and arrested. Though initially found guilty of robbery and assault at a trial in Quincy, a subsequent trial in Yuba county resulted in Arro's ultimate release (Fariss and Smith, pg 215).[/note]
