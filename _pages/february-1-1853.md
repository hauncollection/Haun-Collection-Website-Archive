<p style="padding-left: 240px;">New Orleans Feb 1, 1853</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My kind friend,</p>

<div style="text-indent: 6em;">I have not forgotten my sincere
promise to write to you, though a letter from Mary received
this evening rather startlingly reminded me of the length
of time which has elapsed since I left Georgetown- for
two weeks after one arrival I was busy preparing for
housekeeping and since we have been domiciled, I have her
so occupied fitting up my little birds nest I have had no
time to write with one exception which coverd a letter I
addressed to Mary about a week since.We have had a
most delightful winter. I say have had: for today February
introduces to our unboming hearts and faces, the smiling,
gentle Southern Spring. The residents tell me the season
has her unusually cold, particularly since my arrival; but
it has been so much wilder than the Kentucky cold I left
it has seemed like April weather to me.The children seem per-
fectly happy to be at home again. Nora is going to school,
and seems much pleased. I live so remote from the
heart of the city, with its great public eye and world
bustle. I feel almost as if we were in the country. It is
very quiet in our street, and very pleasant; for we have
all the advantages, without the discomfort, of a more interior
residence.Will you do one the kindest to day to dear Sarah
Wampler West, I certainly should have gone to see her if I
had had time before my departure. You know I had barely
time to arange my baggage after Mr Bradford arrives with
out a moment to devote to any one.We had a very pleasant
passage down the river. I have not seen Mrs Bozzens since
we parted at the veranda. We went up to canolton yes
turday to look for her, but it was so late when we arrived
we had no time to find her and had to return disap-
pointed.I have had the satisfaction of seeing the notorious
Lola Moulez in her own drama of “Lola Moulez in
Barana” She is a little, round shouldered, weazen faced
woman, full of spirit, sarcasm and self conceit, but
of course, an extraordinary and very original person. She is
so beset by woman’s dakness vanity, she makes herself ridic
ulous in her attempt to ape a sinking spirit girl of
sixteen; and you know such “airs and graces” become mere
monkey tricks in a woman of forty-badly kept.Nany tells me
Person Smith has been lecturing you stray sheep for permitting
the poor young folk to dance. Has any one reminded him of
the Fortuneteller and the circus, patronized by his daughters
last summer? I very much fear “the sect called the Phairsees”
has forsaken Jewery.But I must indeed bid you goodbye, dear
friend, for I have many letter to write, and much else to
do tonight. Write to me very soon. Remember me to Mr
Haun and John. If you sould stray to new Orleans, do not
fail to seek me out. We are living on the corner of Hercules
and Euteipe streets. Present my kind regards to all who
love me, and believe me Your sincere friend Annie</div>
