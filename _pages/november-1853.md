<strong>Tuesday 1</strong> - We did not go to work today. I believe the most of us is somewhat discouraged because we can’t find good diggings.  In the evening I cut wood for the cabin till late. Dave proposed to go up ditch so off we went, and John too. As we returned near the cabin I got a shot at a coyote but did not kill, I suppose.

<strong>Wednesday 2</strong> - Three of our company have left off working their claims and gone over to the American Valley to prospect. The other five of us worked today and got $4.25 in the forenoon. In the afternoon, we moved the boxes higher up in the gulch.

<strong>Thursday 3</strong> - Us five is the company now. We worked faithfully and got $4.50—

<strong>Friday 4</strong> - We moved our sluice boxes still higher up the gulch and set them up by noon.  After dinner Dave said he would leave us so none of us went to work in the middle of the afternoon. He bid us adieu and went down to the Point to get a mule ride over to Grass Valley and on to Marysville.  He could not get well, or feel well.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I had the blows the balance of this day and night. Time cures all things.</span>

<strong>Saturday 5</strong> - Five of us got today $16.50. Quite an improvement. After supper I washed shirts,1 pair socks and one of those linen towels Lou give me. It is the only one I have with me. The rest remain in my trunk. I then washed myself and went to bed long after the moon had set.

<strong>Sunday 6</strong> - Up before day. Built a good fire as wood is cheap. Dried a shirt and did some mending on it. I took down the last pair of those gray-footed socks and darned the white in the heel, with the top of another old gray pair of the same. You do not know how careful I am of these old duds that was put together by your fingers. I feel like I’ve parted with a friend when I’m compelled to lay them aside. I always burn them.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">John is mixing up dough for bread. Breakfast is over and I’ve made this entry. I had like to have forgotten last night.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I did some mending on my casinett pants that I got from S. R. Betts--- them and the blue is all I’ve worn in this country. The day is past and gone, no more to return and how have I put in my time. Thoughts, I’ve many.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Cut a ditch on the upper side of my cabin to keep the rains from flooding my cabin floor as a storm is looked for. Somewhat cloudy and the wind from South West. John has gone to bed.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">In the afternoon, went up the ditch with my Virginia friend saw two Grisly tracks one a small cub. I’ve finished my wooden wash bowl tonight. It looks very much like something you know that has a handle on the outside. Good night.</span>

<strong>Monday 7</strong> - Got gold $25. Somewhat better. Fine weather, no rain, cool mornings and warm days. Yellow Jackets are flying about of days, plenty.

<strong>Tuesday 8</strong> - Got gold $11. Quite cool this morning, ice all about our boxes and froze. Our water scarce in the ditch. Had to send two men up it, to tramp the bottom.

<strong>Wednesday 9</strong> - Got gold $8. Warm but cloudy all day. Commenced drizzling late in the evening. On reaching my cabin, my Virginia friend had been to see me as the card pined to my cabin door plainly indicated. All right, Mr. Small, I can’t visit you this evening--its too unlikely over head.

<strong>Thursday 10</strong> - Rained all last night very light and cloudy all day. We got gold $21. The other three partners came home at noon. They say they have found good diggings over at the American Valley. There is no telling.

<strong>Friday 11</strong> - Up before day, from 1 to 2 hours. Have a good pine and oak fire to sit by and not the slightest sound of animal or beast to interrupt my reflections, except an occasional twist or grunt from John as he part on the bed and the balance on the floor.

I often think--and sometimes speak of it to John--that I would not be surprised to see you out here at any time. But maybe, I wish it so. We got gold $11. I concluded, as we’ve made but little of late, to take rest tomorrow, as I’ve not lost a day willingly since I began to work in the mines.

<strong>Saturday 12</strong> - John, myself and G. Kline took a walk up into the mountains. The weather was delightful.  We stood upon one of those bald peaks, north of the volcanic Slate Mountain on Feather River. We could see a great way, nearly all around us.  The air was cool up there. We concluded to retrace our steps to the cabins.

<strong>Sunday 13</strong> - Nine of us concluded to visit Slate Mountain today.  We set out about 10 o'clock and after much hard climbing we arrived at the peak. It was up hill all the way down Feather River. We all went up on the highest peaks of the rocks. It rained against us while up there and on us when going home and continued all night. The pattering on the boards was something new and interrupted my sleep somewhat.

<strong>Monday 14</strong> - Rained all day, occasionally mixed with snow. This I suppose is the commencement of the rainy season. How I am to stand California for the next six months I can’t tell before hand.

I concluded to put lining in the casinett pants I got from S. R. Betts, so I set myself about it. I had some scraps of cotton. I spread my pants out on the table and lay the cotton on and cut a front for one leg and then turned it, cut two others by them. It took some time to do the piecing. At all events, I finished them before I went to bed, which was late.

<strong>Tuesday 15</strong> - Rained more or less all day.

<strong>Wednesday 16</strong> - Commenced snowing early in the morning. It soon stopped at 4 inches deep. Three of us went up the ditch hunting. By night the snow was quite gone. Cut wood and lay it in the corner to have it handy, as I get up from 1 to 3 times in the night. I keep a good fire all night. John does the cooking, we have not dug any since Friday last.

<strong>Thursday 17</strong> - Beautiful day. Seven hands went to work, got gold today $14.50.  My Virginia friend is gone this evening over to the American Valley to take up claims for us there if he gets a good prospect.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">John has just washed out half a dozen flour sacks to line his pants with and is now lying in bed reading some novel.</span>

<strong>Friday 18</strong> - Cloudy all day. Got gold $22. I made a new pattern riffle box to catch gold. Two hands set up one set of the boxes near our cabins.

<strong>Saturday 19</strong> - Raining some this morning. Did not work today. Mr. Small, my Virginia friend, came back from American Valley today while we were at dinner, to get some tools. He is well pleased and said two men has taken out $7,000 in six weeks. John and I expect to go over with him in the morning. John is washing shirts at this time for us. After nightfall he baked three loves of bread, and I cut and packed a good lot of oak wood and set it up against the house by the door.

<strong>Sunday 20</strong> - Up before day and breakfast over by sunrise, and, Small on hand, we set out for the American Valley. We arrived about ten o’clock a.m. We then went two miles farther up the valley to Sister Betsy Gulch[note]Elizabethtown. Consult <a href="https://mapsengine.google.com/map/u/0/edit?mid=zGdLT60XgqII.kXL6JPrxqEcI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">map</a> for precise location.[/note].
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We looked about last night of plowing up a great quantity of gold, some pieces as large as my fist and some smaller. I told of my dream before I went there, so in looking around I picked up a piece that weighed $10.50 off the ground. We stayed all night at the American Ranch. Bradley is one of the proprietors that married a cousin of D. Sullivan by the name of Lucinda Dogg who says she will visit all of her kin in Kentucky when she returns form California.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Ah, I heard a cock crow. This valley near Sister Betsy’s is like a new town going up of log cabins. A great rush for these new diggins. Only been found a few weeks.</span>

<strong>Monday 21</strong> - John and I went out a prospecting with two others and took up one whole hillside and commenced sinking a hole. So, we took dinner on the ground near Sister Betsy’s cabin, and shortly after John and I left for home leaving our two friends to finish the prospect.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I think if you was out here you would be delighted with the climate -- frosty nights, but warm days. The valley is several miles long but narrow. In going up the valley at this time we can see the snow all round on the high mountains, and yet it is so pleasant in the valley. There is from ten to twenty females here, such as they be. Only three last year.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We landed at our cabin after sunset, and that too after a fast walk of 14 miles.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">John complains of being very sore, tried and is lying down. Paid tavern bill to Bradley, $2 each, $4.00. The company got today $29.50.</span>

<strong>Tuesday 22</strong> - Got today $7. We changed both sides of our sluice boxes ---

<strong>Wednesday 23</strong> - Got today $14. Cold nights and warm days.

<strong>Thursday 24</strong> - Got today $12.50. Dobson and I went a-prospecting. We got as much as from 10 cents to 50 cents to the pan of dirt. I dreamed that you had come out to this country but you hardly knew me. Ah, this hairy face of mine, that is it.

<strong>Friday 25</strong> - Before daylight, well the wind did blow. I went out and looked up to see these large, tall pines, the tops were bending about so that I ran in the cabin again. If one could have seen me a-dodging and cringing when a dead limb would fall on the cabin roof, he or she might have laughed if they could. I thought if the Lord was on my side I was safe, and down I lay. It rained all day today, and the night following.

<strong>Saturday 26 </strong>- Snow and rain mixed in the fore-part of the day, and the after all snow. Clear all night.

<strong>Sunday 27</strong> - Commenced snowing at daylight again, ah. I took two flour sacks and cut a lining for John’s everyday pants and fixed them in. He was all of Saturday sewing the lining to the pants.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">After breakfast John went down to the Point. He paid Thompson $107.45 and paid Lewis and Roots $10.50, and then got a letter from my wife of dated September 26, 1853[note]Not included in this collection.[/note]. This is the second one to John since I have got any. This letter gives an account of her unhappy condition. Also of Uncle Solomon’s daily expected death and boarding at Mrs. Chambers’. You stated in John’s letter that you had written one to me two weeks ago. It has not came to hand and none other since the one dated 27 June[note]Martha Haun's letter of June 27 1853 has been preserved and is available <a title="June 27 1853" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/version-iii-series-ii/june-27-1853-martha-haun-to-james-haun/">here</a>.[/note] last ---</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">It has snowed all day. With some rain this evening to pack it down it is near a foot deep and falling still.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">John got a ham, cut the canvass off, cut the ham in two and while it is cooking I made him a towel by hemming it, as it was coarse linen, so much better than cotton.</span>

<strong>Monday 28</strong> - Somewhat cloudy. All went to work.

<strong>Tuesday 29</strong> - All worked, but rained some about noon. Got gold last two days $16---

<strong>Wednesday 30</strong> - Beautiful weather, warm and pleasant. Got gold today $57--- The snow is quite all melted off.
