<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We now have our cabin finished and hewed down the inside. All is in good order and we have been sleeping in it since Wednesday the 19th. As yet we’ve not as much as a stool to sit on. At this time the moon rises before I go to bed and I am up before sunrise. We have no way of keeping time.</span>

<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I am now sitting on the first stool which places me above the ground since middle of July past--a log of wood that I made tonight. Neither have I heard a cock crow since I was 42 years of age.</span>
