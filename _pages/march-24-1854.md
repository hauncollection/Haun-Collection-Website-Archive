<p style="padding-left: 210px;">March the 24 1854--</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My Dear Sweet Husband--</p>
I received your letter
dated Dec the 28th-- &amp; oh how disheartined I am a
bout writing to you when I hear you do not get
my letters-- I have written every thing that I thought
would interest you in the least &amp; yet you have
received so few of my letters that it discour
ages me a bout writing. I had been writing every
week for some time before I got your last
&amp; had determined to keep it up as long as you
remained out there- but I have been discouraged
from it by your not getting them I have sent
you several papers &amp; the minutes of our state
meeting. Just one week after I got your last letter
I was surprised early one morning before I was
dressed by the arrival of Dave on the Lexington
Stage he got to Lexington the knight before--
he said he could not get well out there so
he come back to try &amp; get well. he was twenty
one days from San francisco to New Orleans
he does not look as bad as I expected to see him
though he is their he says he is going down to
Dave Loyds to work &amp; see if that will not cure
him. he is cartainly a singular fellow in his
notions it is not worth any ones while to feel any
interest in him for he will do just as he pleases
&amp; does not appreciate kindness he come back with
out money or clothes-- but he does not care any thing
a bout it he says he can make as much money as
he wants he dont want money. I see no way to
ever make him wright only for every one to be as
indifferent a bout him as he is a bout him self
Jane will start home in a few days Graves has
come for her. I told Dave if he would stay here
with me I would board him for nothing but
he says he must go to work to see if he canot
get well-- I work my self. I have herd out
Kit Wash &amp; Jim so I have none but bet &amp; my self
I have rented all the house at a hundred &amp; thirty
dollars &amp; moved out the little Dentist &amp; have
taken Thomps Finnell &amp; his family to board with
me at five dollars a wekk they furnish their own
room &amp; have their own negro to wait on them
&amp; furnish their lights &amp; the Dentist is a day boar
der a dollar &amp; seventy five cts a week-- Tom Bur
bridge will be a day boarder- but I my self
does the work &amp; have more satisfaction than
if I had more negroes. I help to do every thing my
self &amp; I feel better by it to keep my self busy so
I think I can live if we all keep well we did not
start wright last year &amp; it took me all the year to
get wright--I wrote to you for money I do not
know whether you ever got the letter. Kit will
be confined verry soon a gain-- when ever you
think you want me to come out there write to
me positively to come--for Tomss Kinill says
if I want at any time to quite keeping house he
will take the house of my hands- So if you want
me to go you must write to me to come- if you
can get a few thousand to come back with
in a year from this I think you had better do so
I do want you to come back able to situate our
selies well if you canot do that I had rather
got there or I had rather you would stay longer
as bad as I want to see you thar for you to
come back as poor as you want. there is always
plenty of people to rejoice over other peoples disappoint
ment--- I think you will succeed at any rate if
you do not get enough to come back this year I think
you had better come back your self &amp; arraing
your business &amp; take me with you-- but I believe
you will make enough to come home to stay I think
I can pay my way now verry well. Tomss is verry
obliging &amp; Intilmanly to me in fact every one is
I have no wright to complain of any one. I am willing
to go or willing to do any way for the best then let us
all three do the best we can for the present &amp; do it as cheer
fully as possible believing we are doing for our mutual
binefit &amp; look forward with delight when we shal
all meet a gain- Dave gave me a great deal of satis
faction a bout you &amp; john. I thought I would not
grieve as I had done a bout you any more nor I
have not since he came as yet. I do well know it is the
best thing you could have done but some times I get

would give the world if I had it see you I
can say of a truth I never knew how closely my
verry existance &amp; all my happiness was inturned a
round you. I look forward with so much pleasure
when we shal clash each other in our arms a
gain never to part this side the grow- keep in
good spirits by thinking how happy we will be
when we meet a gain- you must write me often &amp;
tell me all your prospects-- D.H, Smith showed
me a letter a day or or two since from you dated
January the 28th-- Dave has ogne down to Dave
Loyds Loyd Winter has been to see me he
is living in Ilinois he is a great big over grown
fellow--- there is nothing new here that would
interest you-- Johen Lemon lost his wife last
sunday morning she had a baby &amp; left it ten days
old a boy poor Johen seems heart broken- the
Hollyclaws all leaves this week for St Louis--
he laws Pratt mines two hundred dls as a
matter of course it causes some talk---
Henry Cozzens has come and brought up Hates
remains &amp; his baby is a verry fine child
Dave tell me you have to pay 1 dollar for a
letter after I pay to Marysville, that is pretty
tight-- it is a poor solitary life I live
with out you &amp; as to real en joyment I do not
know what it is but I have made up my
