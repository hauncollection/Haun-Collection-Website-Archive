<strong>Tuesday 1</strong> - Henry and I went into town. On arriving we found the town in quite a-stir. The young folks were going to head quarters to fall in line to march out 2 1/2 miles to a May Day party. All went off in good style.

<strong>Sunday 6</strong> - Took a good sleep in my own bed. I found all well.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I met a man by the name of Judge Heath at Gibsonville on his way to my house. He is a friend of Jack and H.P.’s and he wishes to get to mining. We all went down to the Point, I to see after a letter that Henry put in the express office Wells &amp; Co. some 20 days ago. It was mailed from Georgetown, Kentucky. It is not come to hand.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We went home, took dinner, and weighed our dust of the 2 last weeks’ work, $634, and Lawrance and company $320.80, of which we get 1/2, to be divided as the rest of our gold. All four of us loaned I.W. Thompson $1,000 for 30 days at 3 per cent per month.</span>

<strong>Saturday 12 </strong>- Continued to snow last night. The ground was well covered this morning. I was in too bad a humor to work today. The consequence is none the rest of my company worked. I was so much out of sorts that all my worst feelings was roused to the highest pitch.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">The day was unpleasant, somewhat cloudy and drizzling.</span>

<strong>Sunday 13</strong> - The weather is somewhat cloudy and unsettled, thunder but no rain. We all went down to the Point in the A.M. I stuck up some notices to sell P. Freer’s interest in the water ditch and came home again in company with Heath, as the rest had returned. We took dinner, though late. I then talked some with my company. We came to the concluded to go to work again. John still complains.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">My lesson is the12th chapter of St. Mark.</span>

<strong>Monday 14</strong> - All hands to mining, Lawrance and Shults to their place, John and Roister at our old place in the Ravine with the hose and pipe. Late in the P.M. The hose ripped.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Shaw, Rains and Heath was at work near Pike cabin on Shaw’s claim.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I went down to the Point to get a man to come up and make some hose for duct number one, but did not succeed.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">My friend Duesler came up to see after his claim in the P.M. He commenced making our hose. I made four sluice boxes out of new plank.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Cloudy, rain most of the P.M.</span>

<strong>Tuesday 15</strong> - Cloudy and a light sprinkle of rain. Quite cool this morning. I mended the hose, made three false bottoms, and made a pen stock.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">John and Roister got $26 in gold in two days. The rest of our company has not made anything. Duesler is at hose making.</span>

<strong>Wednesday 16</strong> - This is one of those beautiful clear days that is so common in this country. All hands are prospecting and mining but me and Duesler: he is sewing on 50 yards of canvass to make hose, and I am to help him, and also to make other fixtures to set up our new pipe and hose. There has been no gold got today.

<strong>Thursday 17</strong> - It is not necessary to say anything about the weather, as it could not be finer. Shaw and the others set up our old hose and pipe down on his and Duesler’s claim and made a commencement at piping. I and Duesler finished the new hose and expect to set it up tomorrow at our old diggins. John and Roister got gold $39. Lawrance and Shults is taking it out every day.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I thought several times today of making a guess what day this month I will see my wife here. But I could not come to any conclusion as to the day. I could not determine.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Cash paid for nails, 75 cents for company.</span>

<strong>Friday 18</strong> - I dreamed last night of seeing my wife. I thought she found fault of me because i did not speak to her sooner, did not know she was about. I awoke and felt disappointed to know she was not in sight or even with us to scold me--but who can stand it.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We are doing considerable work but no gold today. The wind has been blowing all day but, still and calm at night —</span>

<strong>Saturday 19</strong> - Raining and snowing all of today. Cold and chilly. I went down to the Point in the A.M. to attend the sale of Freer’s interest in the water ditch. Deputy Sheriff Neal sold the interest at 1 o’clock P.M. I was the purchaser, being the only bidder, at $15 for John.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I came home at dinner and went out to work. We let the water on in our new hose and pipe. It does not shoot as strong as was expected. Got gold today $2 —</span>

<strong>Sunday 20</strong> - The ground is covered with snow and it is snowing a little this morning, the sun peeping out at intervals. There is a robin trying to make me believe that winter is past by his constant singing, but he is a alone as it is a bad day to be out.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We had a settlement. That kept us near all day. We had $262 to divide in 4 shares after paying $159 for packing our grub from Marysville. It has been snowing very hard most of the day and bids fare to continue.</span>

<strong>Monday 21</strong> - Snowing all night. It is three inches deep and still snowing this morning—a winter’s day to all appearance and feeling, though we all went out to work. I, John and Rains got gold $72.50. We ripped our new hose into the bargain. Lloyd came over to our diggins from the valley, but Pike would not let him stay all night last night in his cabin. So, he went down to the Point. This morning Duesler bought his claim for $17, so I think we got clear of him for the future.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">My lesson is the 5th chapter of Luke.</span>

<strong>Tuesday 22 </strong>- Clear and cold last night and cloudy this morning. Ice froze along the leading ditches and there was snow in spots on the ground. Somewhat cloudy and sunshine at intervals. Clouded up late in the P.M. Commenced raining, continued at late bed time.

P.M. Ripped the hose again. While we were mending it, the Deputy Sheriff came with three other men and Lloyd, and levied an execution on all my interest in the diggins and water ditch and put him in possession of our diggins. But he could not get his hired man to go to work. Neither would he, Lloyd. We told him he could not get water nor work with our tools. So, he left soon after the sheriff and we to our work, got gold $1. I and Deusler was running a 3rd seam.

<strong>Wednesday 23</strong> - Well, the ground was covered again with snow. A dreary winter-looking morning. I went down to the Point and got a bill of particulars in the case of Cline vs Freer and Vaughn and John bought the Judgement. I got with the bill $31.75. I went home again and to sewing the hose. We finished mending by 2:00 P.M. and went to piping. We got gold $1.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I dreamed last night of being quite feelingly situated with Ann E.W. —[note]Anne E. West of Georgetown, KY.[/note]</span>

<strong>Thursday 24</strong> - Cloudy and sunshine at intervals. Late in the P.M. it rained some.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I sent over to the American Valley to take an appeal of the case with Lloyd, or rather, to give bonds, which I did in the sum of $1,900. I.W. Thompson and Isaac Jennings went my security. I paid my Lawyer Henly $100 and paid $66.75 in clerk’s fees. My dinner $1.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I got a letter from my wife that has been miscarried and I suppose lost. It is dated March 9th 1855 and gives an account of her return to Georgetown and hard times and living at Pratts.[note]Although the description of the content does not match, this may be one of the undated letters partial letters from Martha to her husband.[/note] Letter from wife $1.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I took one of our pipes over to Betsy Town and had the nozzle taken off and a smaller one of 7/8 inches put on at a cost of $4. I went home after 5:00 P.M. Got gold $8.50 —</span></span>

<strong>Friday 25</strong> - Cloudy last night but cleared up today. One of those delight full warm days that we are likely to have for sometime to come. We have all been at work, but without being rewarded in any way, except Lawrance. He is making good wages and 3/4 of 1/2 of what he makes is for me and John —

<strong>Saturday 26</strong> - Cool last night, and some ice about the ditch near the cabin, but the sun rose clear and bright. I started Shaw over to Betsy Town to get our pipe fixed again, as it was with the old nozzle. The rest of us at work as usual. Cloudy in the P.M. with a little sprinkle of rain.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Shaw paid $1 for fixing pipe and gave $3 for another. Got gold $17. Lawrance did not work this P.M. but got drunk for the first time.</span>

<strong>Sunday 27</strong> - Up at daylight. Took a cold bath and read the 10th Chapter of Saint Luke. Ate breakfast and did some mending on our Hungarian riffles, and then five of us went down to the Point. I and John ground three axes, and I got two letters from my wife. The first was dated the 11th April 1855[note]This letter has been preserved and is available <a title="April 11 1855" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/version-iii-series-ii/april-11-1855-martha-haun-to-james-haun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.[/note] and gives an account of the death of Mrs Beaty, and the burning of Harvey Graves’ dwelling house, the instructions of my brother Sant, and the want of love expressed in my previous letter to my wife. The second is dated April 7th[note]Not included in this collection.[/note] without. Part comes from Dave, from Bracken, Kentucky, and what my wife wrote was pend on the 12th of April 1855. She states in it that she has declined coming to California for the present.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">The two letters from my wife cost 50 cents I bought six pounds of nails for the company and went home. Ate dinner late P.M. I then wrote my 19th letter to my wife. Letter cost 37 cents.</span>

<strong>Monday 28</strong> - A pleasant day. Shaw took the letter down to the Point and mailed it. We all was mining. We got gold $42. I shall pay off Shults. He has worked 28 days this last settlement. At$75 per 26 days, his wage amounts to $80.75, and the whole amount I paid him is $181.75 to work the interest that old Lloyd was permitted to work.

<strong>Tuesday 29</strong> - Somewhat cloudy and raining a very light sprinkle at daybreak, but a fine sunny day. I, John and Rains got gold $22. Lawrance and Roister is doing well, but Shaw, Duesler and Judge Heath has not made anything. It is more than likely that they will not all pay at the same time. We have an interest in all the company’s work. We get 3/4 of all that Shaw has an interest in.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">There was a miner died of bilious colic[note]A biliary colic, an illness related to gallbladder obstruction.[/note] on Sunday night last, that lived one mile from our cabins —</span>

<strong>Wednesday 30</strong> - I dreamed last night that I was in bed with my wife and I thought she rather refused to indulge in that social intercourse as man and wife. Well it is no go.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">The day is fine and pleasant. I and John got gold $12. My friend Judge Heath says he is a-going to leave tomorrow.</span>

<strong>Thursday 31</strong> - I and John are alone at work. We got gold $53. Shaw and Rains is still prospecting, and Lawrance and Roister is fixing up to work in the ravine that Lloyd and John first worked together in, as some of it is left.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Well, we came in a little sooner than the rest. I was fixing about and swept away in front of my cabin, and John was washing some of the salt out of the butter. After supper I was mending my pants that I had lined a year ago till a late hour.</span>
