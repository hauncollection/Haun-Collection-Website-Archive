Mr Haun, dear friend,

Allow me to commence by scolding a little, and perhaps I will grow a little more affectionate toward the close of this epistle as you did in yours. Love you know is a strange charmer, and a little jealous of slights, or at least imaginary slights. Now after such professions from you. It seems to me your address is exceedingly formal and stiff. But anyway I should like to see you so much tonight, and have a cozy little chat.

We had quite a snow storm this evening. It seems as thought old King Winter is loth to leave us yet a while. But as I am so cozy at present will not complain of weather’s decrees. I am sitting up in my room by a good hot fire, and have just tucked little Betty up in bed where she is snugly napping. Consequently all is quiet around me, and here am I, not sleepy but in a meditative mood, and somehow any thoughts will dwell on you. I can not account for it—do you think they are profitably employed?

Anyway I intend to drop you a few lines as, tomorrow is Sunday, and it is against my principles to write letters on the Sabbath, as I consider it Sabbath breaking, tending to our carnal duties on a day dedicated for holier things. But then I feel in the mood to talk to you, feel it to be a pleasing performance, and not writing merely according to promise, as you state in yours. I feel as though I had entirely forgotten how to write a letter. I think if I do not practice more I will have to quit entirely.

From the tenor of the preceding, you will think I am disposed to scold. Consequently I shall shall quit. I commenced in a formal style, like yourself. You, toward the last, grew affectionate. So likewise I shall do, to say nothing of the feelings I experienced all the way through, but for the proverbial trait in my character, contrariness, would not give my tender feelings scope, for the sake of a little retaliation. But happiest are those who condescend the most and I will take mine all back. For if I would see somebody tomorrow, not a thousand miles off, but here to pet me and call me loving names, I would not have it in my heart to do anything but love him more and more. Now don’t turn round and call this a Yankee way of apologizing, but rather let a milder term, one more gentle, be applied—just say she is writing this stuff merely for the sake of filling up her letter—

Although I have had bad weather I am enjoying myself, as I will do when I take a notion. You must let me know if you intend to come over tomorrow week. Write during the week, say Friday, and I will get it. Are all well at home? I wanted to write an answer to Mrs Jenkins’ letter tonight, but Betty’s snugly snoozing makes me feel like crawling in myself to succumb to the drowsy God, sleep.

Frank Korper was up this evening to see us. He treated us to lots of raisins and candy, which you know all the children, like myself, love. I wish you would please ask Johnnie Sheritt about my album.[note]Autograph albums in which friends inscribes signatures, personal notes and poetry were a popular trend among young people beginning in the 1600s through the middle of the 19th century. The remnants of this practice can be seen today in the tradition of signing year books and may arguably be considered a precursor of social media.[/note] I never think of it when I see him and am afraid they have lost it. I have had not had it since last summer. Tell him I asked you to get it for me as I want some friends to write in it.

Well, I shall close with a good night kiss for you, and whole heaps and lots of love, in my letter, which I shall close, and seal up as I am sleepy. If you see Mrs J. just say that I will respond to her dear letter on Monday night.

Lovingly you own,

Mollie

P.S. Love to all at home.
