<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We then continued our walk some time in the night in company with a Virginian who had a horse that carried our wallet and coats. We three then spread down his blankets under a pine tree and went to sleep.</span>

<span style="margin-left: 28px;">The last 5 miles we passed a quantity of snow some 2 or 3 feet deep in spots about on the ground. Our feet is quite sore, yet while I write there is several men playing at cards, which is the case everywhere I been in public houses, Sundays not excepted.</span>

<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Old Virginia left his horse today for Major Brookey to ride as he got on a spree last night and was not able to travel today. John and I shouldered the gun and wallet and Old Virginia with us off we started for Nelson’s Creek. Its called 18 miles over high mountains and snow, some 3 or 4 miles over snow that was 10 feet deep. We passed through Onion Valley where the snow had been 50 feet deep. The natives showed me a pine tree near their houses that was trimmed for the wood. That looked as high to me as the sycamores I trimmed for Sam Thompson.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">The last five miles was down the mountain that we had been on top of. We got so weared in our knees that we was often compelled to an sit down and rest. We made the tramp in the afternoon in good time and put up with Dr. Vaughn, a brother of Jim Ware’s wife. I had not long been here before he asked me if I was not a brother of Judge Haun’s. I asked him why he asked the question. He said because we favored. I then told him I was an elder brother. We are within 30 steps of the mouth of Nelson Creek that emits in the middle fork of Feather River. There is a continual roaring of the water. There is diggins all about here.</span>

<span style="margin-left: 65.5px;">Supper each $1, $2.00.</span>
<p style="text-indent: -4.5em; padding-left: 70px;"><strong>Wednesday 22</strong> - Breakfast each $1, $2.00

<span style="margin-left: 28px;">The balance of our company arrived last evening. Lying by today. Expect to start a-prospecting in the morning after breakfast.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I went in a bathing. I found it cold at the middle fork of Feather River just above the mouth of Nelson Creek. I then went a little up Nelson Creek I saw four men digging. They took out $8 per man.</span>

<span style="margin-left: 65.5px;">Dinner each $1, $2.00</span>

Our guide continues to drink. I’ve done nothing today but visit the diggings as we could not get off ourselves, it being my birthday, and 42 years old at that.

I was anxious to start a-gold hunting. This evening I saw two pans, the work of six hands today--about 4 oz[note]At approximately $19.39 per ounce, a little under $80 or $12 per person if divided equally--roughly equivalent to what the six workers who mined it might have expected to make in a month as farmers.[/note] all told.

<span style="margin-left: 65.5px;">Supper each $1, $2.00</span>
<p style="text-indent: -4.5em; padding-left: 70px;"><strong>Friday 24</strong> - Breakfast each 1$, $2.00
1 pair blankets, $8.00
1 pan, Iron, for washing gold, $2.00
6 lbs meat and bread, $2.40</p>
Old Virginia, John and I started up Nelson Creek to prospect. We called a halt at Independence 2 1/2 miles. At noon we crossed Nelson Creek and took up Dickson Creek. Washed out several pans and got the color every pan.[note]When panning, miners would place dirt and gravel in the bottom of the pan, add water, and gently shake the pan back and forth, loosening the gravel and soil and allowing the heavier gold to sink to the bottom of the pan. When the water became cloudy, the miners would gently pour out the muddy water and resume with fresh. This process would be repeated about 10 or 20 times. The miner would then rinse the bigger rocks and pebbles and discard them.

In the next step, the miner would continue shaking the pan, this time tilting it to the side so that any gold might sink to the crease where the sides of the pan meets its base. From there, the miner would begin "washing." Holding the pan almost perpendicular to the water, he would submerge it and then gently lift it out of the water, letting the top layers of dirt and gravel slide away.

When only the finest sand was left in the pan, the miner would add a small amount of water and gently rotate, causing the sand to wash to one side of the pan, leaving the heavier gold beached on the opposite end. After several rounds of this, the gold would be isolated from the majority of the remaining sand. At that point, gently wobbling the pan with a very small amount of water would enable the miner to separate the last of the gold.[/note] Old Virginia said it would not do. We came down again to Nelson Creek and took tea. Our supper consisted of soda crackers, cold roast beef, and midlen meat and water. We spread our blankets and down we lay for the night. O, that hard bed ---

<strong>Saturday 25</strong> - Our breakfast was of the same, that our supper consisted of. Crossed Nelson Creek and commenced panning out. We got the color, but Old Virginia said it would not pay, so we put out for the mouth Nelson Creek. Took dinner and supper of the same, stopped at the inn to eat breakfast, each of us.

<strong>Sunday 26</strong> - I washed some of my clothes and shaved. I wrote my fourth letter to my wife. John added a few lines and gave it to the express man. I paid him 25 cents to put it in the office at Marysville.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Cloudy all day. It snowed an inch or two deep on the mountain a traveler said. It rained here late in the evening.</span>

<span style="margin-left: 65.5px;">Dinner each $1
<span style="margin-left: 65.5px;">Supper for John, $1</span></span>
<p style="text-indent: -4.5em; padding-left: 70px;"><strong>Monday 27</strong> - Breakfast each $1</p>
Clear cool but pleasant.

<strong>Tuesday 28</strong> - Out hunting for gold.

<strong>Wednesday 29</strong> - Out hunting for gold.

<strong>Thursday 30</strong> - Out hunting for gold.
