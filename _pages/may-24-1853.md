Georgetown, May the 24th 1853

My Dear Husband,

I had gone to bed but
not to sleep, your image &amp; my Dear boys
was haunting my memry so much I could
not sleep which is often the case. I lay &amp;
listened at Tom Pullens mocking bird sing &amp;
thought of your until eleven o clock when
I pound I could not sleep so I lit the candle
&amp; commenced this letter. I received your
most welcome letter two weeks a go yesterday
I slept none the knight I received it Joy &amp;
sorrow by turns keeping my mind busy.-
oh God how hard it is to be seperated so far
but I do try to hear it the best I can hoping
it is for the best. Some times I am cheerful
&amp; sometimes sad. there is a fear sometimes
comes over my mind that something may happen
that we will not all meet a gain &amp; when I
feel that way then I am miserable &amp; a gain
I am full of hope &amp; anticipate a happy meeting
but let us try &amp; look on the bright side, if
I could only know that you were both well all the
time I some times fear that you are such &amp; have
no one to wait on you or may be suffering for
the comforts of life. but I try not to think so for
it makes me so unhappy I stopt for the knight
thursday knight. I went to Lexingotn yesterday
evening &amp; got back this. I H Haun and family
are well. Mary had twin daughters not long
since but they were dead born...I was at Mr
Moores all last week liz thinks her health is
better. M G Haun has been to New York
&amp; come by &amp; staid two or three days with me
&amp; wanted me to go home with him he said
he come expressly for me to go with him-
but unless I could have staid all summer it
would have been two expensive &amp; I was a fraid
to do that on account of the chills &amp; a gain I
felt like it would not be wright for me to
leave the negroes some of the children might
get sick &amp; no one to see to them.- lizze garth
&amp; steve Burbridge was married last thursday
they had the bigest sort of a wedding----
I have not been able to collect any money
since you left.. I gave Bat some notes to collect
but his wifes health has been so bad he could
not leave her she is better &amp; he will go next week
he was elected constable a few weeks since
Dickerson says he thinks it is a bad chance to
get any thing where he is a bad chance to
get any thing where he is concerned with notes
I get a long verry well here Pratt &amp; his wife are
verry kind to me. I have no reason to complain
of any thing but I do get verry wrestless some
times &amp; think if I was keeping house I would
feel better satisfied to have the little negroes
with me. though they are doing verry well
Sam &amp; bet are industrious &amp; try to do the
best they can so far they deserve a great
deal of credit.- they show that they have
a good priciple &amp; are not eye servants.-
bets baby is the finest boy she has ever
had.. kit &amp; her child is doing well I
have not been able to hire out Wash yet
to advantage I am trying to hire him in
Lexington to a travern I not know whether
I will succeed or no.. I have kept Lizze
with me &amp; am sending her to school to Mr
Hard on session. it will be out in June &amp;
then I do not know what is to be done with
her I have written &amp; sister lize has written but
get no answer. poor child I do not know
what is to become of her it seems like
killing her to part her from me &amp; if I go to
California I shal take her with me--
brother James told me that he saw Miss Barton
that come right from his neighborhood a few
weeks since &amp; by hard beging he got her to tell
him a bout John she would not say any thing
until he persueded her a long time. she then
said he had the worst sore eyes she ever saw
&amp; had the chills &amp; in fact was doing no good his
health was verry bad &amp; he was drinking verry
badly with all. I expect to hear of his death
in fact I had rather hear of his death than to
hear what I have. I have kept it all from the
poor child. She often asks &amp; wonders why
she dont get a letter from her pa but I put
her off some how. She has written so often &amp;
got no answer. Lizze is growing &amp; improving as
fast as any child you ever saw. the school had
a picnic party last friday &amp; she had to make a
speech &amp; crown the queene. She was more prais
ed for the way she performed them any thing you
ever saw in fact she is verry much admired
&amp; praised for her smartness. ladys have told me
that Mr Hand says she is the smartest scho
llar he has in school when I look at her
&amp; think she must be kept back on account of
means to give her a chance it makes me sorry
for if she had a chance she would do well for
her self.- &amp; if I had any thing in my power I
would never give her to any one until she mar
ries I never will if I can possibly avoid it as soon
as the school is out we will go to the
country &amp; stay until fall or Winter.---
I got a letter from Minerva Foot to day she is not married
yet, every thing is moving a long a bout as it was when
you left.- Elie &amp; Tom Holtzclaw was taken up in
MO last week &amp; taken back to Madison Indiana &amp;
lodged in Jail to wait their trial in Sept next they
was taken back in irons there is no chance for to get
baile, the family is greatly destressed a bout them the
poor old people is truly to be pitied.---
my own dear husband take care of your health &amp; of
my dear boy if it was not for the hope of seeing you
a gain I could not live, oh this world is a perfect blank
with out you, write to me often &amp; give my love to all of
them &amp; oh my precious child tell him not to forget me but
not to be melancholly, farwell farwell my

[sideways]
dear husband let us get to gather a gain soon as we can some where

[upside down]
your devoted wife Martha Haun
