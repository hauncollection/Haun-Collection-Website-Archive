My Dear Friend,

Yours of the 12th[note]This letter has been preserved and is available <a title="April 12 1864" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/version-iii-series-ii/april-12-1864-mollie-burns-to-john-j-haun%E2%80%A8/">here</a>.[/note] was received the evening of the 15th. Somewhat like yourself, just as I had collected my writing materials the bugle sounded for inspection, when I had to drop everything until it was over. So Billie F. and Gabbie are to be married at last! Well that is somewhat a surprise to me. I never thought that would be a match from the way he used to talk, but there is no dependence to be placed in people nowadays, don't you think so?

It would seem you are fond of young preachers. I used to think you were partial to that class of people and now I know it I have prophesied you will marry a Methodist preacher. I imagine I hear you say “pshaw, you don’t think any such thing” but I think I am correct in my belief. Well they are generally good kind individuals.

Mollie, how much I could have enjoyed your meeting had I been there. The announcement has just been made that there will be preaching to us by a Rebel Colonel this evening, but I expect I shall not hear him as I prefer writing to you at this time—not that I dislike preaching by any means. I think I could tell some yarns equally as hard as the young preacher if not more so. I cannot see any just reason why you cannot accompany my person as well as another to California. Emigrants to California are unfortunate, especially when they start from Georgetown, in some respect. This makes two to my knowledge that have been refused. I should like to accompany him to the above named place. What has become of Sallie M.?

I have just received a letter form my mother stating she had received one form me since I have been in prison. Please send the reply you made to Jessie’s question. You say you wish it was in your power to assist me. I am perfectly well satisfied you would do anything you could to assist me without your saying so. I expect to be sent round on exchange ere long, as I do not expect to get released on any other terms very soon.

I very very often think of the evening spent with you and of the present you have for me. You recollect I have not shaved since I have been a prisoner. You can imagine I look very rough about the face. I must come to a close as we are only allowed to write one side of paper. Wish I could write as much as I desire, for I have only written half as much as I would like. Goodbye for the present. Write soon as you can, while I remain your friend, and just imagine you see a package ten feet square of that article you mentioned in yours which I sent you. Excuse this poorly written production,

J.J.H

Commit this and all others of my to the flames and obey, J.J.H.
