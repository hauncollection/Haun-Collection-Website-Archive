Friend John,

I will drop you a few lines to let you know that I am still in the land of living--but there are a good many here that hardly live. Times are terrible dull here and plenty of idle men are about. I called in four or five paint shops and found men siting around waiting for a job, but I have been pretty lucky so far. I helped a man a couple of days on small jobs and I got six dollars for my help, so I Am fixed a-plenty and I have the promise of a job Wednesday.

I found Mr Joshu. He has quit the painting business. He says there are too damn many painters--and I am a little like him. I am getting disgusted with it. Every day he is very thin has very poor health. He is now a book keeper for some parties in the city. I have got a room in the house where he rents on fifth street.

I called on Emit the other day, and like him very much. Well, have you sent for Mollie? I have been thinking it would be best for you to have her dispatch sent to Emit in case I may be out in the city at work And it would be safer to have the dispatch sent to him, for he is right at the landing. Let me know when you send for her and I can go down to Emit’s stable every night or so and find out when he gets the dispatch, and then I can meet her at Oakland. It would be safer to have her dispatch go to him.

Well how are you getting along with your crop? Have you plowed any since I left you? You ought to put in all you can, for I tell you, times are very tight.

I am going to try painting for a while and if I can’t make it go I will take to the woods. I think I will come down and bug Ross and see if I cant go in with him and tend his place on shares. I think I would make a farmer.

You have no idea the difference in climate between here and there. I have been cold ever since I landed here and down there it is so nice And warm.

Well, John, this is Sunday and I have just been out to Woodword Gardens with Mr Fosha. I met Peat Howard, Doc Hall and Fent Whiting out there. They say that the roads are terribly bad up there. They came by the way of Reno.

Give my kindest regards to your pa and ma. I will close. Love to All.

Direct your letter to Rottbury 2, 23 Corner of Fifth And Clementina[note]Consult the map for specific location.[/note]
