Dear Friend,

It is Sunday, and I have stolen away to my room to commune with you for a while before going to Sunday School. Sister Fannie is in spending the day with us. She is living away out of town as I think, at Mr Eason’s place, and the little Hats keep up too much noise to think of attempting writing near them.

It is a very pretty day. There will be quite a large baptizing at three this evening which I shall attend and look for you and me too as you use to attend them. About half of the college and Mr Farman’s girls will be there as usual every spring.

I do not remember whether I told you of John Roach’s death in my last or not. He killed himself with whiskey. I attended Gabbie’s infare[note]An old fashioned term for a wedding reception.[/note]. I never had more fun in all my life, and they had the prettiest set table I have seen for a long time. Such as Mrs F. in her exquisite task alone knows how to set a tabled loaded with all rare delicacies, and an abundance of music. Gabbie looked as sweet as a peach, Billie as though every cloud has a silver lining. He told me that he thought he had accomplished wonders in getting Minnie. Barnie and Jennie are also united in the holy bonds of wedlock. I was invited to attend, but it being in the morning at three I did not go. I could not get up to attend my own wedding at such a time, as I told Jennie. But I knew I would be up all night at Mrs F.‘s and did not wish to appear dull and uninteresting. Miss Lizzie Mills marries a Federal Colonel the last of this month.

I received a letter from Dora yesterday. She sends her kindest regards to you. Andy Jenkins or Reed arrived yesterday. I wish that you could enjoy this lovely May day associating with friends and home. I suppose you can fully realize the full import of those two little words “At Home” as you have been one of the many that has forsaken all, home and friends, to harken to your country’s call, which few know how to appreciate till lost.

I am corresponding with a Mr John H Collins from Mississippi, a prisoner at Rock Island though Albert Crumbaugh’s influence. Jimmie is still in Canada. I was quite surprised when I received the letter from R.I. I answered it requesting him to tell me how he got my address, and he wrote me word that A.G.C. was quite an intimate friend of his. His letters are very interesting, and he, like you, is willing to excuse bad penmanship if I only will consent to a correspondence. You must manage to get here some way to see us before going back into the army.

I have not much news to communicate at present, as our little town affords none. Tommie L. says howdy. I intended going to Louisville, Missippi, Annie Price, Dora and myself on a visit the later part of June or the first of July, as Brother Spruell says, no providence preventing. Mike Barlow is still here. Quite a number received letters from their friends in the south yesterday.

You have not shaved since you left. Well you know what I admire and think is most becoming. If you must, primp when you come to see me, but I shan't be particular if I could only have a short look at you, if long ones are not allowed.

Write soon. As you know Mollie, or Chalk, likes to hear from you often.

Your friend,

Mollie C Burns

Lots of ___________
