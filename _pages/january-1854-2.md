<strong>Wednesday 4</strong> - All dates previous to this are lost by the burning of the cabin and my trunk. Still working in the drift all day came to where the bedrock run up nearly perpendicular--a bad sign for gold. About to give it up and try another place. Pa went to the Point in the evening to send a letter below. No more today.
