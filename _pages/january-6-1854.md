<p style="padding-left: 180px;">January the 6th 1854</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My own Dear Husband--</p>
I commence
a letter to you-- with verry little hopes you
will receive it-- from  your last I preceiv you
do not get near all my letters-- I sent one by
Emma Smith that was-- she married a man
from San francisco by the name of Rings &amp; left
the same day for that place the poor old
man took it verry hard you have no I
did what a satisfaction your last letter
was to me. I told some of the many inquoers
a bout you how you were doing &amp; it flew
like lightning over the town the people seem
to take great interest in you at any rate they are
always inquoring after you-- we are all well
I have written three or four letters to you
telling you all a bout my going to house keeping
&amp; presume you have goten some one of them &amp; it
is useless for me to write any thing more a
bout it-- I have collected verry little
money since you left &amp; you know I had
none &amp; I found with the kind of negroes I
had women &amp; children it would not do
for me to board &amp; rent a house for them
it would bring me deeply in det in spits of
all I could do besides runing the risk of loor
ing some of them by not being taken care of
Kit will have another child this spring &amp;
bet you know has always one or like for
one- Kits child is just one year old &amp; as a
matter of course no one would give any thing
for her this year so I have to keep her at home
&amp; try &amp; make her do something-- I have one day
boarder &amp; intend to take more if I can get
them &amp; make her &amp; bet try to earn something
that way-- I have hired out Jim for twenty
five dollars this year-- I have not hired
wash yet he is such a tricky mean rascal
no one that knows him will have him I am
trying all the time to hire him I will get him
off after a while-- it has cost me two hundred
dollars to go to house keeping &amp; lay in my wood
&amp; every thing two hundred covers all my exprce
&amp; if you will send me that much I will not
ask you for another cent whil you are gone
for I know with an ever start I can keep so
unless some accident-- remember I have a
helpless family of children to take careof &amp; kit is
having children twice as fast as ever bet did &amp; you
know I can get nothing for her to hire her out it
will make a fortune for some one a raising theer childre
for her &amp; bet will stock the town in a few years
at this rate-- So you see my dependence it is
a slim one the way I am situated but if you
can &amp; will send me two hundred dollars I think
I will not have to ask you for any more---
please send it if you can as soon as you get
this-- I do assure you I am trying to do the
verry best I can-- I know I get all the
letters you write I can tell by the way you
write-- Jane Graves is here a part of her time
with me &amp; a part in Lexington with all of her
children a spending the winter they are all well
she send her love to you John &amp; Dave wrote
a letter to you for Jef Shepards sake tell me
if you got it Isadore Burnse sends his best
respects to you &amp; says tell him. I have not
nor ever will forget him I canot tell you
all that wishes to be remembered to you
but almost every boddy-- poor old brother
Smith will have me read your letters to
him &amp; seems to feel a deep interest in you
Tom Barkly has brought Frosts house &amp;
gave six thousand dollars payable in four years
oh if I could only know to knight while
I am writing this rest now you are what a
pleasure it would be but eleven months
of the time has passed off &amp; as long as you
have gone there for the purpose of making mon
ey &amp; have gone through so many hardships try
&amp; perservre until you get enough to settle us
well some where oh how hard the seperation
but if ever we are fortunate enough to meet a
gain nothing on this earth will ever seperate me
from you a gain I will follow you go where
you may. oh how I long to see you my own
to urge cannot express it but when I think of
you coming &amp; having a plenty to situate us well &amp;
all being to gather once more it makes me bear it
all being to gather once more it makes me bear it
&amp; long for the time to pass off for I feel lonely
with out &amp; ever will no difference how many
people I see- I have lried with you so long that
it seems almost nessary to my existance to have
you with me- I do pray God he will prosper
you &amp; my dear boy &amp; from it me once more in
this world to clasp you to my heart &amp; feast
my eyes by looking at you &amp; hear the sweet famil
liar tones of your voice I feel like good old
similan that then &amp; not til then I could lay me
down &amp; die-- give my love to Dave &amp; tell him to be
sure to come home with you when you come till John
to write to me, farewell my prescious husband
your devoted wife until death
