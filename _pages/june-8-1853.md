My own Dear Son-

How often in my imag
ination do I see your loved form &amp; features
hear the sweet tones of your voice, it seems that
I can hear you say ma, so plain at times &amp;
then to think that you are so far from me &amp; the
fear &amp; dread that I may never see you again on
earth seems to pierce my very solle, but I
will not nor do not indulge nor give way to these
feelings no more than I can help for if I did
I would go deranged or die. I keep in company
all I can to keep from steedying or indulging
in melancholly. it is the only way I can get a
long “every one is kind to me &amp; I see a good deal of
company” my health is better than is was when
you left, or for two months after, my health
was bad after you left, &amp; I fell off until I
was quite poor. but ever since I received you
pas letter informing me of your safe arrival
I have been fatning up again &amp; am quite cheerful
but oh the uneasiness I suffered until I heard you
had arrived safely, but I have tried these
many years to harm to look on the bright side
of the picture my sense &amp; better Judgement tea
ching me that is no advantage in any way

[upside down]
in a situation to live comfortable &amp; your energy &amp; enter
prise will give you a standing in this community with the
very best-- give my love to all of them that are kind
to you &amp; to your dear pa be kind to him &amp; give him my
my love, do write you and him) farewell my darling,
your devoted mother until death M Haun

derived from being always in trouble under any
circumstances, &amp; when I think that our abject
is a good one, &amp; that we all believed it to be for
the best, I try to be satisfied, &amp; if i could only
know that you &amp; your pa was happy &amp; satisfied
I could stand any thing but I fear that you
are unhappy or disappointed or sick or some
thing else, oh my dear son if we can all be sp
ared to meet again &amp; be able to get us a home that
we can make a living on. I think I will be the hap
piest being on earth, &amp; do you &amp; your pa make it
your object to get money enough to buy a farm of
two hundred acres &amp; come home as quick as possible
just think how happy &amp; independant we could
be places in that situation. I do try to prserve
my health so that I will not look so old &amp; broken
that you will not know me, &amp; tell your pa not
to listen or be swayed by the opinions of others for
it has never done him any good but a great deal of
harm &amp; you &amp; him consult each other &amp; lay your
own plans &amp; do not be persuaded against your vice
but have an object in view to accomplish &amp; make every
effort to do it, &amp; I now of nothing that would be
so much honor to you or more satisfaction than to
come back here able to by a farm, -- Mary
