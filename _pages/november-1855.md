<strong>Thursday 1</strong> - The nights are quite cool, I’ve continued severing on the hose of nights till a late hour all this week. John and Jack were sawing up  logs for wood. Bill went down to the Point last night in a hurry after a few things and hasn’t returned yet. Drunk we suppose. I am still sewing.

<strong>Friday 2</strong> - Quite cool and windy. The clouds a little North of East, directly opposite the way for rain. John and Jack did some sawing for wood. I am working at the hose. Bill came home drunk soon this morning, stayed a while and went back again to the Point.

<strong>Saturday 3</strong> - Still cold. Icicles froze about the spring last night, one foot in length. I am at work on the  hose. John and Jack went up to the bear traps and got timber for two malls. I made them split some logs late in the evening.

<strong>Sunday 4</strong> - I indulged in a morning lounge in my bunk. The sun had risen before I got up. While breakfast was preparing, I was minding my dirty shirts. After eating I prepared to wash three shirts and two pair socks. Before I had finished, two strangers came and hindered me some time. Dinner was had and I dried one of the shirts to put on. All three of us went down to the Point. No news for me. Bill came from Rabbit Creek and went home with us sober.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">After supper I read the 20th and 21st chapters of Saint John.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I gave $1 for a bottle of gin </span>—
<strong>
Monday 5</strong> - Not so cold of nights and warm days again. The boys did some sawing and splitting and I was at work on the hose. Thompson sent us up a lot of provisions.

<strong>Tuesday 6</strong> - Pleasant weather indeed. It is rain we want. The boys did some splitting of wood and I almost finished sewing the hose tonight.

<strong>Wednesday 7 </strong>- After a late breakfast (we stayed up till a late hour last night) we of course did not get up soon. At all events we found ourselves going up the ditch to put more cross timbers to keep up the covering out of the ditch. It has had the appearance of rain all day, a few drops fell at dark.

<strong>Thursday 8 </strong>- Before I got up I found to my great gratification that it was raining, as the drops on the roof of my cabin was quite audible. However we all went out to the diggins to work as the rain was quite light.

P.M. Jack went down to the Point and brought me up a letter dated September 20th 1855[note]Not included in this collection.[/note] from D.H. Smith giving an account of the death of B.W. Finnell. Also a form for a release of security for me in the clerk’s office of Scott County, Kentucky as guardian for my son. He wishes John to sign and return the same to D.H. Smith.

<strong>Friday 9</strong> - Cold and frosty this morning and a clear sunny day. We were at mining, but not able to do much as the water is still weak, the rain being quite light. We dug out a large cedar stump.

P.M. We cleaned up and got gold $4. Very light for the work. After dark the wind blew and before we went to bed it was snowing.

<strong>Saturday 10</strong> - The ground was covered with snow and kept at it lightly all day. Cold and unpleasant. In the A.M. we reset our boxes. In the P.M. we done all the washing we could and got gold $9.

<strong>Sunday 11</strong> - The ground was again white with snow. I built a good fire and went down to the ditch and washed, standing with my bare feet on the snow. It froze. I then read the 12th and 13th chapters of the Acts.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We put in our time till noon splitting wood. In the P.M. John quick-silvered the contents of a sand bottle and got gold $13. I and Jack went down to the Point.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Cloudy all day.</span>

<strong>Monday 12 </strong>- The snow was falling fast this morning. About ten o’clock the sun shone out. We went to work then, there being plenty of water as it had rained considerable in the night —
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">My friend Duesler came over from the American Valley and told me that Lloyd was over there trying to get out a warrant against me for an assault and battery on him. Duesler took dinner with us. We did not clean.</span>

<strong>Tuesday 13</strong> - The sun had risen before I left my bunk. It was snowing gently and continued all day. It being warm, the snow melted away. We got to mining.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I cut half a dozen buttons off my old pants that I brought from Georgetown and threw them on the fire—gone.</span>

<strong>Wednesday 14 </strong>- Last night was quite cold. Ice is hanging to the eves of the cabin. I was awoke form being cold. The clouds is passing from North East to South West, denoting fair weather — About noon we went out to mining. The sun shone, but it was not warm. We did not clean up the boxes, as we supposed there was no gold worth the trouble.

<strong>Thursday 15 </strong>- Cold frosty this morning. Breakfast over, I and Jack went down to the Point. While there constable Ritchey from the American Valley came with a warrant for me to appear forthwith before Squire Starkes[note]Lewis Stark, nicknamed Squire Stark was among the first settlers to travel through Beckwourth pass and the founder of Elizabethtown. The community was named after one of his daughters. In 1853 Stark was elected justice of the peace, and reelected in 54, 56, 57 and 58.(Fariss and Smith, pg. 286.) [/note] for committing an assault and battery to be tried at Betsy Town. I told the officer that I could not go over until tomorrow. He went home with me and stayed all night. Bill and John was getting wood all day.

<strong>Friday 16</strong> - After an early breakfast us four and the officer started for Betsey Town. The day was a little hazy but the sun shone out warm. We stopped at Quincy. I consulted a lawyer, Haydon, and he went over to make the best out of the case. We asked the court for a change of venue, but it was not granted. A jury of 12 men was had. Lloyd and four other witnesses stated that I had struck him over the head with a cane I usually carried. The jury found me guilty of the charge and court adjourned to set on tomorrow at 10:00 A.M. I was left in the hands of the constable in the same room where I once—and the only time in California—bowed in submission to God in a congregation and preaching by a Methodist. I was fined $150 as a rival or disturber of the peace, &amp;c.

<strong>Saturday 17</strong> - I went to bed quite late last night, as sleep was gone. I lay cold and sleepless for a long time, but was awake at cock crowing again and got up a little after daylight. We breakfasted. I walked out with I.B. Taylor to see his diggins and returned. The court was soon in session, and fined me $150 all told. Taylor loaned me $50. I paid the fine, paid our tavern bill for all four $10, and started for home. We got across Spanish Creek that runs through the valley. We stopped to watch a horse race and saw two. The sun was getting low when we again started for home on foot. We arrived some time in the night, took supper and went to bed —

<strong>Sunday 18</strong> - Up at day light and read the 3rd and 4th chapters of Romans.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">The morning is cool and frosty but cloudy.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I.C. Lewis sent us up 600 pounds of potatoes. We all went down to the Point.</span>

<strong>Monday 19</strong> - I and Jack went down to the Point and prepared to go down to Marysville. We had to wait for Thompson’s train. We took dinner with Mrs. Fox. Later we mounted the horses and drove 58 head of horses and mules up the hill in company with Thompson and Read and two Mexicans. We got to Onion Valley after sunset. The wind blew quite hard and it was very cold. We traveled on to Grass Valley, 19 miles more over the snow and ice and stopped for the night.

<strong>Monday 26</strong> - Breakfast over, Bub paid me $150, all the money he had to spare. I and Jack started for home. We went by Tucker Flat diggins where we stopped and took dinner with  Mr Doroty. I gave two of his daughters three small specimens, and we then went by the Sand Hill diggins. We stopped a while by there and, at dark, we fed our horses at Mr. Bridger’s and got our suppers, and then  rode home by 10 at night.

<strong>Tuesday 27</strong> - I helped the boys sack two loads of wheat. It rained some this forenoon. The wagons loaded and gone to town, I helped Jack and Derick to build a shed to keep their wheat dry after it was sacked.

P.M. We sacked more wheat out of the granary.

<strong>Wednesday 28</strong> - The weather had the appearance of rain, but merely drizzled. We sacked wheat and sent it to town.

<strong>Thursday 29</strong> - We were still sacking wheat. Joe Ficklin came home from town and said that the steamer Golden Age[note]The December 3 <em>Sacramento Daily Union</em> reported that the Golden Age left New York 24 days before carrying one hundred firkins of fresh butter for sale in Washington.[/note] had arrived at San Francisco. The news had come by telegraph.

<strong>Friday 30</strong> - The teams hauled two loads each to town today. H.P. and his wife and children came home early from town, as they had gone in the day before. They brought a paper out that had the names of a Mr. and Mrs. Haun and child.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">So I and Jack got in the carriage after supper and went to town. It was very dark. We had got to the stable and Jack was getting a lantern when the Boat whistled down at Feather River Bridge. Down we went and just as I got near the ladies’ cabin, who should I see but my wife coming out following Dave and Lizzy. We kissed each other and went out to the carriage, all five, and started for H.P.’s. Arrived safe in good time.</span>
