<p style="padding: 12px 16px 14px 16px; color: #555555; background-color: #e8e7e7; border: #d2d0cf 1px solid;"><em>This letter fragment of unknown date belongs to the period of John Haun's incarceration at Camp Chase. In it, his mother Martha Haun urges him to keep up his spirits and expressing her anxious desire to see him again in California.
</em></p>
...must try and tell us what we can do for you. At any rate, my dear, son keep up good spirits for that will have a great influence upon your health. I think it is the fate of war. Bear it as well as you can and think it will not last always, and when it is over, you are not like most of your poor comrades, striped of everything but will have plenty to come home to.

Now my precious son I must bid you farewell again. Oh how much I want to see you none but God knows. Hope keeps me alive. I feel that God will permit us to meet again on earth. I will not suffer myself to despond but put my trust in God believing that he will do all things and that we will meet again in peace. Never give it up but try and maintain your rights, trusting in God that he will prosper those that put their trust in him. Farewell, farewell my son. Write on the receipt of this to your anxious and devoted parents.

M. Haun
