Cumberland Ohio July 19th / 64
<div style="text-indent: 4em;">My friend Mr Haun</div>
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">I must acknowledge your very wel</div>
come letter of July 3rd which has remained unanswered for reasons which
I will now explain. First I wrote to you on the very same evening you
wrote to me July 3rd rather singular is it not “has to be” I suppose and by
the way it remains unanswered yet not only that but as I told you in
my last your letter was torn off at least the most interesting part of it
so you see I know but little of its contents. You said you had gone to a
new comp and not knowing where to direct my letterI directed as of old
to Prison 3, and have been waiting to get your reply and know if it rea
ched you. But fearing you have failed to get it I will “try again” Your last
letter came safely was not torn as before I was very glad for I think it would
have been too bad to have had those hearts torn apart don’t you wonder
if they belong to anybody in Camp Chase I think not for I see they
are union “red white and blue” any colors don’t know who’s they are
but think they are perfect, and before I go any farther must tell you
you have received very many compliments from two or three of
my confidential friends who have seen your drawing you ask
if I like birds you would have thought so if you could have seen my
attentions to any dear little Millie a canary bird a present from
a lady friend living in Nowark Ohio He had just died a day or two before
your letter came, consequently the sight of your birds only served to
renew my grief. I know its foolish but one will become so attached
to the innocent little creatures However I think I might find som
thing of more serious nature to greave for in these times. I am
pleased to find you prize my flowers and will not laugh at you for eat
ing the withered leaves you cannot say now you out never shared a meal
with you, for I remember well when I was pressing them the leaves kept
falling and I gathered them up and ate them never thinking you
would do the same I am affraid their beauty would be gone for they
came near being “the last rose of summer” was affraid the leaves
would all fall off I am so glad you got the magazine at last Mrs S called
a few days ago to rectify a mistake concerning the price of the magazin
I said the price was 37 cts instead 25 I judged from the amount of change I received please
don’t think I’m in the habbit of giving presents and telling the price I would
never have mentioned it but I felt a little indignant when I thought you was
not allowed to receive my book and unconciously let my disposition get up.
do you blame one; But it will teach one to not be quite so hasty next time
Maggie was just pleased when I told her what you said, she said to ask you to
remember her as a friend Of course I think the women have a right to their
opinions as well as the men, but don’t believe in hurting feelings when it can
be avoided. I am very glad anything I can do may cheer your prison life
I can assure you it will be freely done When you assure me I have driven half
the horrors you are compelled to endure away I feel as if my "bread was not cast upon
the waters” in vain but feel a little sad to know such things must be I pray
God this terrible war will soon close In my last I told you I was going to C--
soon but have given it up for the present My Merce Maggie G was to acc
ompany one is still quite ill poor girl, she was engaged to a young Lieut who was recently
killed and the shock seems to much for her I have taken my place by her bed
and will remain here until she is better she thought it was not so until a few
days ago when his sword and belt was sent home How many bright anticipats
are blasted by this war Mr Haun I am so glad you are good enough to put the
right construction on things I do and say. I was almost affraid you would
think one fast sending a bouquet to a perfect stranger but we are not stran
gers but friends I think. I know to I have written things to you that might
appear strange on so sort an acquaintance, especially the unexplained
But believe me my motives are good and pure, it was only by accident I
knew anything about you and of course feel an interest that I cannot in oth
ers in Camp Chase. Yu will soon find I write just what I think its perfect
ly natural can’t help what is natural I hope I will soon get a letter from

[aside]
this has become natural of late

Camp Chase I would like to know what excuse will come this time Must quit
for fear this never reaches you, but could write more
