June the 31st 1854

My Sweet Husband,

I received your kind of pres
cious letter on wednesday last the 28th of June it was
dated the 28th of May. Just one month to the day coming
this is friday tonight the last day of June. I commence this
letter &amp; expect to write some in it every day or two
until time to send it to start for Calafornia the 15th of
July. I started one last tuesday to out the first of
July as the mailes only leave New York the 1st &amp; 15th of
every month well you have been sick &amp; I not there to
nurse you or try to comfort you &amp; make you comfortable
oh what a pleasure it would have been to me I do believe
that our spirts are permitted to commune with each other
for you will see when you get my letter buy the mail
of the first of June. what my feelings were at the time of
your sickness you mos not out of my mind sleeping or
waking for two days. it was the time you was sick if
you get that letter I speak of it will till you how I felt
when you was sick &amp; you know I had no chance of knowing
any thing a bout it until you wrote to me in this last letter
so it canot be suprstition but I do believe that god per
mits my spirit to hold communion with the spirits of those
I love your letter was verry satisfactory with the exception
of your having been sick for you are making money &amp; that is what
will shorten our sepration your getting money---
I stop for the knight---

if they do go in oct I am determined to go with
them for if you are making money there I will
not be the means of your breaking off to come to me
when I can go to you &amp; I will know I would in
lay it so much in stead of complaing I would be pur
fectly happy to be with you &amp; live that wild romantic
life with you out there for a few years. I never was
in better health in my life as soon as Tom &amp;
Laura comes back I will write you a gain what they
say &amp; when they will go. I am in high spirits at the
prospect of going &amp; perfectly delighted. Dave is with
me &amp; says if he does not get wright well he will go
with me this fall &amp; go right in to the mines. we talk
of how snug &amp; happy we could all be there in a little
cabin in the mountains my self &amp; liz to keep the
house &amp; each while you all get the gold &amp; then of a
knight we could all talk &amp; laugh &amp; be happy to gather
&amp; making money at the same time. Dave has dispepsy
he is better now. So keep in good spirits for I will see
you if we both live this fall or I suppose it will be winter
before I can get there for if Tom &amp; Laura does not go--
Dave will go with me. I will go &amp; I will know I will not
be in your way but be a help &amp; satisfaction. So when I
get there we can stay as long as we please &amp; when
we feel like it will come back &amp; if you think it would
do to take Sam write to me he is verry anxious to go
I some times think he could be trusted &amp; if he was to go
&amp; prove faithful he would be of great servic &amp; a gain if
he was to leave us we would only loose him which we are
likli to do at any time I think it would be as good a
plan as any to take him or perhaps the best for her
would not be of much account by the time we got back
if we leave him with me what to do &amp; say positively &amp;
do not leave it to me but do tell me just what to do
I do not want you to quite out there after having gone through
what you have until you got a fortune if you can do
that by staying long enough &amp; I do not want nor will I
stay a way from you longer than I can get to you for there
is nothing to hinder me but these negroes &amp; I have sacrificed
enoug on their account I am so anxious to go I know I would
enjoy it so much in stead of taking it hard or you says to think
I just want yout o see how happy I would be living the
life you have discribed---I hardly know what to say to
you a bout Sam he has got badly pailed &amp; Talks &amp; acts
as independ as if he was as white as I am since last christ
mas he has not been any thing like as good a negro as he
was last year he is verry imprudent. I think the only way
to do with him would be to take him or sell him if I go
I want you to write me as soon as you get this on the
other hand if you have made as much as will satisfy you
&amp; intend coming home this winter let me know &amp; all will he
wright or if you think I ought to stay here unitl you come
be it long or short tell me in your next &amp; I will try as I
ever have have done to obey you do my dear husband advise me.
tell me in your next how much money you have made since you have been
out there--- please send me the money I asked you for---
tell my dear boy I will by the next mail send him a long
letter tell him he is still the pride &amp; joy of his mothers heart &amp; will be
while  she lives. now my sweet husband I must close this
business letter without giving vent to my feelings in a
way I feel to wards you- you will know that if I was to express
every feeling of affection &amp; sacfice I feel I would have to
write all of my time oh if I could only kiss you when I
write all of my time oh if I could only kiss you when I
say good bye your devoted wife while time taste

July the 24th
well you will see it has been a long time since

called influenza &amp; they both have it it is after ten
oclock at knight &amp; I do not expect to sleep much to knight
though I am berry tired having worked verry hard
all day.-- in the morning the children are better

of her troubles. I must tell you what her troubles
are. This day week a go. Tom Johnson of San fran
cisco &amp; her daughter Laura ran off &amp; get married

Tom has been cutting a big tiff since he come back from
calafornia &amp; courted &amp; married in six weeks. Mrs
Millers only objection was Lauras going to calafornia

ran off &amp; Tom told me he was going back in Oct
