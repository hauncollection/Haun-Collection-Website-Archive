Mr Haun, dearest of all,

You letter did not reach me until yesterday morning. I expected one Saturday and then, thought you would be over on Sunday, and so consequently would not write. When you did not come, I attributed your non appearance to disagreeable weather but fully expected a letter on Monday evening, and then to be disappointed again! It was more then I could stand. You may think me foolish and weak but I certainly had a cry over it, even as I am penning these lines. I cannot bear disappointment and then, I get uneasy, imagine a thousand and one things might have happened.

I received Mrs J’s letter Monday evening, read it and then finished in a cry. They all laughed at me—Mr and Mrs K., Sallie Marvin said it was because I did not hear from you. Mrs J did not mention your name in her letter, consequently I thought something might have happened, and she would not tell me, for she always has so much to joke me about. I made them believe it was something in her letter I was distressed over. I suppose it was the mood I was in. I know my feelings partake of the weather, so you see it would not be surprising if I did have the high-strikes[note]A common malapropism of the time meaning to have hysterics.[/note] with such weather. It seems to me that the Heavenly Father is about to transfer the Ocean to our part of the globe—talk of Midway burning up—I just wish it to wash way. You will be more apt to be gratified.

I thought of coming home the last of this week, but cousin F. will not hear to it. She says we have been so weather bound that I should now come till we have seen round some, but I wish you would go up and see ma ask her if she wants me to come home, and I will come immediately. I intend to have the naming of that new kin of mine.

Poor Johnie F. His death was sad indeed. I suppose you have heard of the death of Lord Elander of Woodford county? A dispatch reached here yesterday from Chicago, Illinois where he died of consumption. Such is life—vast earthly possessions are but morphine, and cannon protract our stay when the grim master calls. I am glad to hear that Julia has, like Martha of old, chosen the better part.[note]In fact, in the bible story it is Mary who chooses the better part, while Martha is too caught up in worldly things.[/note]

I intended to write to you tonight, but have promised Mrs M. to stay all night with her, hence I have written this morning. I cannot slight somebody by not writing to him, if I do everybody else. Give my kindest regards to Frank R., and tell him I am still expecting that promised letter. So Frank A. is at last married.
We got in the buggy and rode round yesterday to see the creeks and bridges. The roads are all overflowed but we take a ride every evening, rain or shine, for we cannot step out unless we ride. I suppose ma has heard of Mrs Melon’s bother freezing to death—Jessie Colbut. I have not written home because I think ma hears through my other corespondents.

As my paper is giving out ,or at least this sheet, and they are calling me to dinner, I shall close. Write soon, and come over Sunday if you can. Surely after the 15th we will have some pretty weather. I long to see the sun again.
Hubby, I shall close as you like—lovingly by your own, Tootsy,

P.S. I shall look for you.

- M.C.B
