<p style="padding: 12px 16px 14px 16px; color: #555555; background-color: #e8e7e7; border: #d2d0cf 1px solid;"><em>In anÂ undated postscript to one of her many letters to her husband during the period of his absence from February 1853 - November 1855, Martha Haun relates the latest Georgetown news.</em></p>
P.S. I forgot to tell you that Orval West and Mary Roy is to be married next Tuesday morning. They will go to Louisville and stay a few days. They will board with Keen Applegate until fall when they will go south. Mary Chambers and Ben left this morning for Texas, never to come back. They went with their sister who has been in from there. Mary has laid off the bloomery. The old lady says she is going next fall. Tom Othwell is here. Him and Jack Flowroy has bought land adjoining in Arkansas and will go to it in the fall. If every one leaves town that wants to there wont be any town here soon. Ben Bradley, D.H. Smith, Alvin Duvall, Dr Keene, Will Crockett and some three or four others are going to Chicago this month and if they are pleased will move there in the fall. This town will be left to the Wests yet. Cauly has sold his house to the widow Nutter for seven hundred dollars. He will leave soon.
