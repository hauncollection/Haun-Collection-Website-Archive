Oct the 18th 1854

My Sweet husband

I received your kind &amp; welcome letter
this morning with a check for two hundred dollars for which
I am truly thankful. I had written a part of a letter
last knight to you. but I comence a gain. I received a littor
from you just two weeks before this last one of date 15th August
we are all well &amp; have been all summer. I am getting a long as well
as any one could I suppose in my situation Thomass Kimell &amp;
family are going to keeping house in a week or two I will have
no more family this winter than I can help owing to the
scarcity &amp; high price of eatibles. it is a loosing business to
keep two or three boarders they will not pay more than three
dollars a piece a week &amp; that will not begin to do the way provisions
are selling home now meal is one dollar per bushel flour five
dollars a hundred butter 25 &amp; 30 cts per lb &amp; beef 8 cts a pound
sugar hams 15 cts &amp; camon hams 12 1/2 cts a lb so or so
you see every thing is as high a gain as it was when board was
two &amp; a half dollars a much &amp; then that boards will not pay
but fifty cts more &amp; that will bring any one in det to feed
now at that price say nothing a bout the fuel they burn
so I will have no family this winter but liz &amp; my self of
white ones &amp; then we are not obliged to have things no
matter at what price. Sams work will feed us all or verry
near it. there has nothing been raised here this summer on account
of the draught irish potatoes has been a dollar a bushel all
sumer sweet potatoes two dollars there is little or no fruit
I stay at home nearly all the time I do all I can I keep
my self busy to pass of the time &amp; feel much better satisfied
that way than in company I miss you &amp; John more when in com
pany than I do at home iwth my family attending to my business
I go to church of Sundays &amp; to prayer meetings &amp; my friends  stop
in to see me occasionly--- I have abandoned all thought of
going to Calafornia Tom Johnson talked to me a bout its advised
me not to go he said living in the mines was so different from
living any other place &amp; a gain he said it would not cost you
less than three thousand dollars for me to go &amp; stay a year on tues
billy graves come to see me &amp; advised not to go he said he knew
how we felt both as a bout being a part but he said I would
only a hinderance I am expense to you &amp; it would not be
the satisfaction to us that we might imagine to be to gather
there in the situation we would have to be he also said you
were trying to make money &amp; I ought to be contented to stay here
&amp; take care &amp; be as little expense as I could so considering
all things I think it best to give it up &amp; content my self
to stay where I am praying for the time to come when you
&amp; John will come home. billy graves has showed a dis
position to be verry kind to me he come to me a few weeks
after you left &amp; told me that any thing he could do to befriend
me in any way he would take a pleasure in doing it if I would
let him know he has several times told me the sam thing-
oh how much more land to me are stranger than conexions
that thing I have fully tested in my life it is true Thornton
Moore has said to me you are wellcome to come &amp; stay at my
house &amp; I thought of doing so befor I went to house keeping I went
out on a visit &amp; staid a week or two that convinced me that
I could not live there it is my wish to save money when
&amp; where I can but to live there to do it I cannot
I had rather live in any hard situation upon earth of I can
him in peace. So I am determine let what will befall me
never to go to any of my kin for a home. I will do the best I can
but to put my self in a situation to be tyranized over by kin
I never will liz sent in for me last Saturday I went
&amp; stayed until Sunday evening the are bid to me in their
way they send for me a bout once a month I will not hire
a horse &amp; Buggy to go to see any one. I have not heard from
Dave for several weeks you know I told you in one of my
letters that Dave said if I was so anxious to go to Cal he would
go with me-- but in his last letter to me he said he could
not go this winter so I have given it out all things considered I
think it best-- Tom Whites property was all sold by
the sheriff last week or rather he sold it but was compelled
to do so the house sold to Henry Rucker for Sixteen hundred
dollars- they have moved up to her mothers---
there is no news much of any sort in town that I hear of
property is stil verry low- you seem to have a great many
friends judging from the inquirys they make a bout you
the church is just a bout as it was when you left there is a great
many say to me give my love to you when I write--
Tom Johnson &amp; Laura left a week a go for San francisco they
are coming back in the spring Mrs Millo takes it verry
hard parting from Laura. I think you &amp; John will come in
the spring I feel like you will I have made you a large jar
of peach preserves &amp; tell John I made him a two gallon
jar of the nicest brandy peaches I ever made I intend to keep
then sealed up for him until he comes let it be long or
a short time &amp; the same with your presous liz
has made you both a beautiful pair of slippers
&amp; I am knitting you socks I have kept the shirt you took
of this morning you left just as you wore it &amp; a collar of
Johns as he wore it oh how I pray for the time to come
when we will all be to gather once more for I had rather
live five years with you my dear husband than fifty with
out you oh when I can throw my self in your arms a gain
for protection &amp; sympathy &amp; love &amp; company you &amp; every thing
it will be more than happiness to me then if you feel as I
do you will make the time as short as you possibly can-
Frank Rankin told me he got a letter form John the
sam day I got the other one of yours he came down &amp; tald
me a bout it it seemed to please him verry much he
said he never got a letter than done him so much good in
his life he said he answered it immediately--
I had like to have forgotten to tell you that old Ben Ford is
dead he died of old age I suppose. give your self no uneasy
a bout me but keep in good spirit looking forward to
the time when we will see each other oh what a stimulous to
have that in anticipation it bouys me up to over come my
feelings all unpleasant ones that the time is not far distant
hen I will see you I have so often thought of a poor widow
that had no hope what would I do if it was not for the hope
of seeing you a gain but I do hope &amp; it cheers me up &amp; let it do the
sam with you-- lizzie is going to school she sends
her tom to you &amp; gone now my sweet husband I must
bid you forwell tell my boy his mother loves him as devotedly
as ever he is truly a part of my heart &amp; not neglect to write to
one I have sent him a long letter some time a go
