Dear Brother,

I received a letter from Henry exploratory of a check enclosed just two weeks ago. Since that time I have traveled from Iowa to this place. I have been here a week, but expect to go to Bracken where I left my trunk last spring. I shall in all likelihood leave New York for California then in the first ship that leaves in October next, provided sister Patty comes with me, which she says is a fixed fact. I shall be there sooner if she should in any possible manner be prevented from going– a circumstance which I hardly think can occur.

I further think we shall come by way of Panama, as I think it is much the safest way. At the same time I shall have an eye to cheapness. I am hoping very soon to see you. I shall say no more at present.

Your Brother,

D.L. Haun

P.S. My dear husband and son, I will, if life is spared to us all, see you by the last of October. I received your letter on Thursday last written in July asking me to come and stay one or two years. You are doing so well there I had rather go to you than for you to quit to come to me, and I had rather die than try to live without you longer.

I am in fine spirits and feel that I can stand anything but to be separated longer from you. I know I will be the happiest mortal on earth if I live to get there and find you both well. You must both of you meet us in Marysville, for I want you to conduct me over them mountains to your cabin. How happy we will be. Give yourself no trouble to prepare for me for I will be just as happy to meet you in your cabin as I would to meet you in a palace. I know I will enjoy this life. Lizzie is coming with me. She won’t stay. I will tell you everything when I see you. So look out for us. We will have a nice time together, all of us, Dave, Lizzie, John, you, and myself.

Goodbye! Your devoted  wife,

M. Haun
