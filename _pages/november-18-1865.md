Saturday Night Nov 18th
<div style="text-indent: 4em;">Miss Burns</div>
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">My own Mollie dear</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10em;">yours of the 16th</div>
has just been received but unlike my frie
nd will give it immediate notice you
tell me not to scold but I cannot refrain
for I think you deserve a good scolding &amp;
if you will be candid you will say so
yourself for your know you have treated me
very badly and then you try to blarmy
me into a good humor by saying your bea
u prevented you from writing one whole
week you know very well no one could
cause me to neglect you that way. probably
you think it is right to treat me as you please
I could not imagine what was the matter
was afraid you was sick infact I ima
gined a thousand &amp; one things. I would have
started over to see you to day but it looked so
unfavorable I gave it out. you dont know
how uneasy I have been because I could
not hear from Mollie. but I will forgive you
on conditions you will tell me all of your dre
ams when I see you. speaking of dreams I
have one to tell you concerning you &amp; mys
elf. I was in frankfort yesterday and met
with Mr B.J. Laughlin a fine looking
gent I suppose of your acquaintance. He
asked me if I was not the sweetheart of
Miss Burns which I was unprepared to
answer and set me up astanding at first
but I told him I had visited the lady. He
said he recolected of seeing me gallant
the prettiest woman he ever saw once at
the Catholic church rather chappel I told
him I was there only once in my life &amp;
I thought I had the prettiest one in the house at
least. so we became friends &amp; of course took
a very small drink together to the health of
Miss Mollie B. He said you bragged a great
deal on me but I told him he certainly
was mistaken in that particular he lives
near the chappel so he says said he had
not seen you for six months. I will tell you
more about him when I see you. Gabe F
says I had better wait for her I told her Billy
looked to much like he would live a long
time yet she said not more than four or
five years Mollie I have recvd a letter from
home would you like to see it or not &amp; what
I wrote back. but it seems you are getting
very negligent when in I am concerned
I shall not give your love to the red headed
girl. what you say is true in one respect I
dont love her half as well as I do you although
you treat me so mean I love you still. if som
body loved somebody as much as they pretend
somebody would treat somebody a little better
don’t you think so love I was at papa
Burns last sunday had quite a chat with
sis Dora I told her you was in love with an
other fellow &amp; I was going to set to her now
as I had always had a fancy for fat girls they
looked so good &amp; clever. your pa says he will
give me the authority to bring you home
if you dont come soon I told him just
to fix it up in writing &amp; would bring
you in a hurry he said he would Dora
says your Ma &amp; Fannie &amp; her were talking ab
out us marrying your Ma &amp; Fannie
came to the conclusion we would not while
Dora thought we would quite interesting
wasnt it. I dislike the idea of you going
persimmon hunting with those fellows &amp;
not here I’ll just tell you what I am jeal
ous sure enough I already believe you love
somebody else better than somebody how is
it. do you want all the news. well dont hide
your face when I tell you mat Long has a
small responsibility whether it is a gal or
boy child the letter never said. my regards
to C.F. &amp; tell her she has by best wishes
Mollie do you want to see you right bad prob
ably I will come over next week maybe saturd
ay write with pencil again if you choose
if it is more convenient &amp; it will suit me one that

[sidways] loves Mollie truly &amp; devotedly how bad I want one of your honeyed kisses

[upside down] good bye sweetest of all things

PS Mats baby is a girl
