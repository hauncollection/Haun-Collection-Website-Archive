<p style="padding: 12px 16px 14px 16px; color: #555555; background-color: #e8e7e7; border: #d2d0cf 1px solid;"><em>This copy of a promissory note and accompanying notes from Alvin Duval, a Georgetown attorney, appear to relate to a much-debated inheritance, also alluded to in Martha Haun's letter of April 11 1855[note]</em>This letter has been preserved and is available <a title="April 11 1855" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/version-iii-series-ii/april-11-1855-martha-haun-to-james-haun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.[/note]<em>.</em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">“$183. One day after this date I promise to pay to C. West on order one hundred and eighty three dollars, for a value of $200. Georgetown February 19th 1845.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1"> (signed) H.P. Haun”</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The above is a copy of the note from H.P. Haun to C. West filed in the Scott circuit court. I brought suit on this note in October 1845 to July to the payment of it. H.P. Haun is interested in the estate of his sister Elizabeth, who had died in September 1845. Mr Haun returned from Iowa and paid the debt, and at the May town 1846 the suit was dismissed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The note which J.H. Haun took with him to California appeared by his receipt to </span>West is for one hundred and eight dollars executed August 15th 1843 to John Applegate and by now signed over to said West. It will be seen at once that the two notes are not the same as Henry supposes, but different in amount, date and pass on to whom payable. January 30th 1854.</p>
