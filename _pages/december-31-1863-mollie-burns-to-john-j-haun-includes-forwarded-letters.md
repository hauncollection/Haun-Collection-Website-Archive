Read and forward at once to Mrs Haun. That’s a good lady– Poor Mother. I’d like to telegraph the boy’s letters to her, if I could. How are you?

Mrs Webb,

You no doubt will be surprised in receiving this note from a perfect strange, but read further. I am under obligation to the mother of J.J. Haun, having been to their house in California about six weeks since and promised her to write you concerning her son John. He and I had been very intimate friends. In fifty nine we came from California in company with each other and in the fall following I expected his company on my return, but was disappointed. If you can give me any information concerning him I would be very thankful for the sake of his parents. His mother is almost wild about her son, not having heard from him for a long while and having but little idea whether he is amongst the living or the dead.

I intend returning to California again in March next, and anything that I can learn from you of John will reveal to his mother and father when I see them, or perhaps would write immediately.

Write soon and please excuse the liberty I have taken in thus addressing you.

Please direct to J.P. Kinsely, Patterson, Juniata County, Pennsylvania.

Dear Friend,

I enclose a letter which was written to Mrs Webb by a friend of yours concerning yourself and parents. She sent for me yesterday morning. I went to see her and she wished to know if I had heard from you lately, and handed me the letter to read. I told her it had been some time but I was expecting a letter every day, so she said she would answer his letter, and enclose your letter to her, in his and [illegible] you had been heard from since and was well. She also sent your address to him. Perhaps he will write to you. Late in the evening I received your letter, so I went directly to see her thinking perhaps she had not started her letter, but she had mailed it.

She sent to Mr. Chambers and got the letter back and had Berty open it and say that a letter had been received since the above was written from you, that you were well, and seemed to be very hopeful of getting out.

You say you like advice from a friend. Mrs Webb, speaks very highly of you indeed, and says she would talk to you and advise you as her own son, and, being a mother, she can feel for yours. She requests me to send this letter to you, and to say to you for her: “For God’s sake to take the oath, come home and, go to your mother.” She told me to tell you that you were not stout enough to endure the hardships of a soldier, and not to linger in prison, for there is no telling when this thing will end, and not to distress your mother. If she had another child with her it would be different. I told her I did not expect you would take the call for fear of being branded as a coward, but she says if we stop for what the world would say it would be a bad policy, and that it is a duty you owe to your mother. I think Mrs Webb is about correct in her advice, excepting the going home part.

Don’t be surprised, but I like Mrs Webb very much. She seems so motherly in her disposition. When I started home it was almost dark and very slippery. Nothing would do her but she must send someone home with me. I thanked her and told her I was not afraid but, “child,” she said, “I am afraid for you. You might fall and hurt yourself.”

Now if you had been here I might have let you come home with me, for it is very slippery. There is a deep snow on the ground which has lain for a week or more, it is now snowing very fast. We have had the coldest weather ever known in Kentucky.

John, Mrs Webb asked me some very funny questions and when I would answer her she would look at me so strange, as much to say, “I don’t believe you.” But I am a truthful young lady ain't I? You can testify to that, can’t you?

I was wondering if you did not suffer this cold weather with cold. I am sitting by a good warm fire and hope you are as comfortably situated as myself. Ma has just made some hot mince pies. I wish I could send you some in this letter.

You ask me if I had seen or heard of your letter to a lady friend. I read the first but not the last. I am at a loss to know what you mean. In regard to George Jackson, he never waited on me in his life. I would prefer someone a little more intellectual, not saying but what he is a very deserving young man, but I know nothing about him. Mr Jerry Stevens has come back to live. Mrs Dorsey is dead. I attended her funeral and John Warren’s yesterday. His body arrived on Monday. Mrs Tom Johnson lost a little girl Christmas week. Poor Sallie, she seems to take the death of her grandma very hard, and I fear it will not be long before she will have to give up her husband, and then she will be entirely alone.

Jim Beatty’s son Johnnie has taken the oath and come home. Mike Barlow writes that he is a broken down soldier and is coming home. Gabbie and Billie are more desperate than ever.

But I must tell you something about our fair. We cleared about $120. Gabbie and I took in
at our table the first night $21.30, Gabbie being sick the last night I took in about $23.50. George Fitzgerald and I arranged the cedars around the room while the others dyed it. We were complemented very highly on our good taste. We had quite a fine time. Most all the boys have been trying to kill themselves getting drunk this Christmas.

You say you would give three brass buttons to have a chat with one. Well I declare “Three brass buttons the whole amount.” And you advise me to marry a widower; good advice. I always did think you appreciated me very highly, and now I know it. I don't think I could allow another theft after that. It looks like you think too much of a fellow. But I must hush my foolishness by asking you to make some allowances as this is Leap Year[note]It seems that Mollie alluding to the popular folk tradition that a woman may propose marriage to a man only in a leap year. 1864 was of course a leap year.[/note].

But for want of space I must close. As you have your friend’s address you had better write to him. I think if you were to treat a wife as you have your mother, you would make some poor brokenhearted creature a good husband. Write just as soon as you get this, while I remain your friend,

Mollie B.

In great haste

<span style="margin-left: 340px;">Mrs Webb's letter of the 11th January
<span style="margin-left: 440px;">Extract for Mrs Haun</span></span>

"I have written three times to young Haun, sent his Mothers letter to him, and also made a copy on a single page of large paper. As soon as he sends a “permit” I will most cheerfully attend to all his wants. Please assure his mother that I will, as far as possible, be a young mother to him and he shall be provided with everything he can receive."
