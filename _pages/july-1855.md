<strong>Monday 2</strong> - At half past 4 we got in stage for Marysville. Took breakfast at New York Ranch, $1 and dinner at Peoria House $1, and were in Marysville by 3:00 P.M.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Very warm indeed—the mercury is at 105 in the shade.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I saw H.P. and we started out for the ranch. I gave a hackman $1 to haul me out to the river. All well, but thin of flesh. Jack is harvesting with 20 hands will get his grain cut this week.</span>

<strong>Tuesday 3</strong> - I and the Judge went to town. We stayed all day took dinner at Frank’s Restaurant, cost $1.75 for wine and H.P.’s soup and whiskey 50 cents. Late in the P.M. I and Shaw started for the ranch. Arrived at sunset.

<strong>Wednesday 4</strong> - This is the fourth. We stayed out all day and helped to fix a force pump in H.P.s well to throw water all over his dwelling house and around it. At 3:00 P.M. I, Henry, Cath, and the children went down to the Simpsons’ and took dinner. We had roast pig and fried chicken, &amp;c. Shaw and Jack went to town, as there was no work done. We went to H.P.’s about sunset.

<strong>Thursday 5</strong> - All hands to work. Shaw and Jack came out betimes.

Henry and I rode on horseback. Ferriage yesterday, 25 cents; dinner at Frank’s $1.50. I paid for Henry and myself. I  left $30 with Haun &amp; Martin to pay the supreme clerk’s fee. I then changed off $192 in gold dust and left $150 with Henry to send to Dave, as he has written H.P. for money to come out to California again. Slept with Derrick.

<strong>Friday 6</strong> - I and Shaw breakfasted at Frank’s Restaurant for 75 cents each. I bought a clean shirt for $2, and paid stage fare on the old line to Comptonville, $3. We each ate dinner at Key Stone, $1. Arrived in Comptonville at 4:00 P.M. We looked around at the diggins.

<strong>Sunday 8</strong> - We set out on foot for Emery’s Crossing on the Middle Yuba[note]A painting of Emery's Crossing is on display at the <a href="http://collections.si.edu/search/results.htm?q=record_ID:siris_ari_141709" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">California Historical Society in San Francisco</a>. Consult the <a href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">map</a> for precise location.[/note] two miles down hill, and stopped some time until stage came along. Paid $2 each to Nevada City, 13 miles. Took dinner for $1 each at the Cherokee[note]The town of Cherokee was named for its founders, the Scott brothers, members of the Cherokee tribe, and was located 2 miles North of Tuolumne City. The site is marked today by a <a href="http://www.sierranevadageotourism.org/content/cherokee-no-445-california-historical-landmark/sie3E39204E910458E93" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">historical marker</a>. Consult the <a href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">map</a> for additional details.[/note] diggins and hotel. This is quite a mountainous country and good diggins all along to Nevada City. This place is a large mountain town and nothing to keep it up but gold dust taken out of the hills all around it. We arrived at 3:00 P.M. and hunted up the stage office where we registered our name for Marysville again, to start at 7 A.M. tomorrow. We paid $5 each for the ride, if we are fortunate enough to get it in this hilly country. It is quite warm and dusty, and has been since we left home.

<strong>Monday 9</strong> - Paid for supper, lodging and breakfast $2.50 each. We are now ready to leave for Grass Valley and on to Rough and Ready and then to Marysville. Arrived at 3:00 P.M. Dinner at Empire Ranch $1 each. We then bought another new cotton shirt at the cost of $2 each, and then for the bath house. I took a  shower, cost 75 cents. I got $20 of the boys and let Shaw have $10 and then gave $5 each for our stage fare to Gibsonville and $1 each for a bed at the Western House.

<strong>Tuesday 10</strong> - We was called up at half past 3 for the stage and after 4 we set out. Took breakfast at the Peoria House cost $1 each. As for dinner, they stopped at the New York but I did not eat. It has been awful warm and dusty. We arrived at the Rabbit Creek House after sunset. Supper and lodging $1.50 each. Here I lay on the best bed in California.

<strong>Wednesday 11</strong> - Some time before day I was waked up by a drunken Frenchman that was quite noisy until daylight. Breakfast $1 each and whiskey 75 cents. At 8 A.M. the mule train came in. We soon started for Gibsonville and arrived at half past ten. We next started on foot for Onion Valley and arrived just in time for dinner, cost $1 each. We next made Nelson Creek at 1/2 past 2 P.M. We soon went up to our diggins. They were cleaning up rather soon but had 7 oz, save one dollar. We had to clean up, as John had been living in the other cabin and then my hickory shirt had to be mended which I  did. I read the 17th and 18th chapters of Acts of the Apostles &amp;c — Lloyd has taken possession of the cabin we bought of Pike by pulling the steeple, as he had bought the 1/5 he is law-proof, that’s certain.

<strong>Thursday 12</strong> - I had a good night’s sleep last night, and did not wake up till sunrise. I and John went to work at our same old place. We were running off tailings; did not see the color. The other boys were at work on the ditch some in the A.M. but are digging away at a large pine.

<strong>Friday 13</strong> - I was sleeping away, the sun one hour high was called up by Shaw. I and John was cleaning away tailings, roots and stumps in the old ravine where we worked last March one year ago. No gold.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">After supper I was setting at the side of the door of the other cabin after sunset. I heard something like distant thunder. The cabin shook and the boards rattled on the roof, a slight shake of the earth </span>—
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Shaw and Lawrance have gone down to the Point.</span>

<strong>Saturday 14</strong> - We are still cleaning away the tailings. I’ve been handling rock so much my fingers is worn through to the quick. We got gold $8 and Lawrance’s company have taken out $226 in the last two weeks. I and John get the one half. Fine weather.

<strong>Sunday 15</strong> - A beautiful morning as is so common. The season has passed for the robins to sing, and, O, shall I again hear that voice that haunts my memory by day and by night? I still hope.
Lawrance has prepared to go to Comptonvill to collect some money. We all went down to the Point and collected $200 of John Bass, and put $100 more to it and got Williamm Timberman to take it and the other $130 to H.P., making in all $530 to send to Brother Dave to come to California.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I saw Tom Eve down at the Point. He is at work down below Hitch Bar, working in the river for $3 per day and board. My lesson is the 24th chapter of Acts —
</span>

<strong>Monday 16</strong> - I and John are piping away, and Shaw and Roister are at work in the lower diggins. A man by the name of Priske came up to see me to know if it would suit me for him to buy Shaw’s interest. I told him Shaw could not sell me a partner. He told Shaw that would suit him but Shaw would not let him buy. Late in the P.M. Westonhaver came to see me, one of H.P.s neighbors. He went down to the Point to see after his horse but did not return according to promise. No gold.

<strong>Tuesday 17</strong> - I and John are still driving ahead. We got gold $6. John bought Shaw’s entire interest in the diggins and water ditches, tools, cabin, provisions, &amp;c. all for $550 to be paid in six weeks. Shaw and Roister got gold $73 including yesterday’s work.

<strong>Wednesday 18</strong> - We moved our hose and pipe down to the lower diggins. Shaw is working in Lawrance’s place. Roister is working for us. A short time before dinner we were getting ready for work, but we washed quite a hole in the ground. It clouded up and thundered once, but can’t rain. I’ve had the piles the last three days, somewhat inconvenient.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I dreamed that Jane Cooper was a widow and had two children and that she wanted me to marry her &amp;c...</span>

<strong>Thursday 19</strong> - All four at work in the same place. Our hose and pipe works well. We washed down two trees, one a large tree.

P.M. it clouded up, thunder and lightning with quite a  shower of rain mixed with snow, almost hail. Did not clean up no gold —

<strong>Friday 20</strong> - We are still looking forward, onward and upward. The truth is I begin to feel that I dislike for Shaw to leave us. There are none left as a partner. But that I was pleased heretofore. We turned another tree up today. We’ve not cleaned up. Lawrance came home this P.M. He did not get his money and I felt more like giving in than I’ve done for some time. Not well.

<strong>Saturday 21</strong> - Well, I, John and Roister is all that is left of the great mountain company. Lawrance sold out to Roister this morning for $200 all the interests he had that was in the lower diggins.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Us three went to work. I cut off three logs and John and Roister cleaned up bedrock and then rolled the logs to one side. We got gold $47. I and John gets 3/4 and him 1/4. I paid Roister $79.25 for grub and pick sharpening for the company —</span>

<strong>Sunday 22</strong> - I read the 7th chapter of First Corinthians. We all went in to a general settlement and dividing of gold dust. I paid Shaw $66 that I had previously borrowed, leaving $100 more to be paid of the same sort and squared up with Lawrance. I and John gathered up two hickory shirts apiece and all five went down to the Point. Mrs. Duesler washes for 3 bits[note]Thirty-seven cents.[/note] apiece. John gave Dr. Hill $10 for pres and medicine. Shaw gave us a bill of sale of all he owned in these diggins and we gave him a joint note due the 1st of September next for $550. I got a letter from Brother Dave dated June 10th 1855[note]Not included in this collection.[/note] written in Iowa and stating he wanted money to come to California again, also, my wife’s need of two or three hundred if she continues in Kentucky. We have taken out since Friday the 2nd of February 1855 $403.50 at $16 per ounce in Shaw’s John’s and my company, and in Lawrance’s company since October last $2136, and Duesler’s company took out $200 in 4 weeks, &amp;c.

<strong>Monday 23</strong> - Shaw and Lawrance started for the American Valley early and bid adieu to the Haun diggins. Well I felt sorry they have left us, but we three went to work in good earnest and got gold $17 without cleaning up the boxes. John stopped up the reservoir this evening for the first time. Water getting scarce. I dreamed of seeing my wife riding in a small wagon with several little Negroes. I thought she was coming to where I was, but seemed distant.

<strong>Tuesday 24</strong> - I dreamt last night of flying. I thought I enjoyed very much. I thought I was where wife was, and a number of other persons as well. John went to bed and left the door open. I woke up cold just before day. We three was at work soon and late. We got gold $66.50. I and John eat in the other cabin with Roister but sleep in the one we built. The other cabin belongs to us also. We got gold $62.50. I commenced a letter to my wife.

<strong>Wednesday 25</strong> - We are at work soon and late. We did not clean up boxes. Got gold $15.50. I feel lonely since the boys has left. The punishment is great.

<strong>Thursday 26</strong> - I was up before sunrise. I built a fire in my cabin and then went over to the other and built another to cook breakfast by and called Roister. After working hard all day we got gold $66. We cleaned up bed rock and then the boxes. I finished my 20th letter to my wife. After supper John and Roister went down to the Point and mailed it, and I am all alone of the once great mountain company making these little entries. Not a voice to be heard except the screeching of a grass hopper, the wind blowing softly through the tops of the tall pines.

<strong>Friday 27</strong> - I am at a loss to know what to note down. It is everyday alike, except some days we don’t get gold, as was the case today. While we were fixing to work the diggins Shaw and Lawrance came to us stopped a while. Did not say they wanted anything. We cut down a pine tree to keep it from falling on our hose as we have the roots to move. I think we will get the stump out tomorrow, and one by the side of it too.

<strong>Saturday 28</strong> - We have nothing to detain us from work, except cooking. besides the enjoyment of making a good day’s work as is sometimes the case. So we shove our selves to the diggins and try and keep up the excitement. we succeeded in getting one stump out by noon and the other down. After dinner I felt more like taking rest, but that wont pay. We we cut and dug the dirt off and rolled out the large stump and cleaned up the boxes and quit. Got gold $76. John made pancakes and we had them with syrup and tea for super.

<strong>Sunday 29</strong> - After breakfast we three went up the pike ditch and cleaned out the head of it. We next divided our gold dust. Roister’s 1/4 amounted to $65 and our 3/4 to $195 at $17.40 cents per ounce. We took three axes to grind and two picks to have sharpened, cost $1.50, and got 20 pounds potatoes for $2, and paid $1.50 for washing two shirts each for me and John.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We came home and got dinner rather late. We next went up the other ditch. It is in good order, but the water is rather scarce as the snow is all melted off the mountains. We had supper and then went to dividing our grub as there is but two of us, we with our 3/4 of it, and Roister 1/4. Yes, I paid Shaw $100 that I had borrowed of him.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">My lesson is the 13th chapter of Second Corinthians.</span>

<strong>Monday 30</strong> - We were rather late getting out to work but hung on faithfully all day. We set up another set of boxes as the diggins require it. John was cutting a leading ditch to the main one to get in the deep water from the reservoir. Roister and I was piping in the second set of boxes and got gold $24.

<strong>Tuesday 31</strong> - I was called up to my breakfast. The rats waked me up several times. I dreamed of wife. There is always something in my sleep that tells me it is not so. I am not with her and why am I thus tried, only to be cheated?
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We were at work in the right boxes. Got gold $22. We cleaned them up and set them anew higher up, and then set up a third set of boxes on the left as the diggins are wide. We had to mend and tinker them up. That done, we quit for the day.</span>
