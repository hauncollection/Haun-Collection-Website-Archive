My Dear Husband,

The last letter I received from you was dated the 28th of October. I received one from John last Friday dated the 3rd of December. I wrote a long letter to John the same day I received his, which was on the 13th of this month. I  also sent you some newspapers. I wrote to John last Sunday night which makes two for him in one week, and week before last I wrote you, which is also in this month, which makes two to you and two to John. This is the third one to you since I received your last. I wrote one to you of three sheets of paper two or three months since. I would like to know if you ever got it. I also wrote to John the same week I wrote that to you. I wrote another a week or two after that—that Jeffry Shepard wanted me to write and the Wednesday before Christmas I sent you another by Emma Smith that was. She married and left on that morning for San Francisco. Write me whether you have ever got them all or no.

Frank Powell was to see me this evening. We had a long talk about California. He is going back this spring with stock. He says it takes a man some time to get in the way of money and to understand if he says he knows he could now make a fortune if he was there mining. He thinks you ought not to think of coming a way yet. He says you have been there about long enough to begin to know how to get along. I was asking him what he thought about me going out there and he says he would advise me to go, for if I am there you would be better contented to stay until you make a-plenty. Farther, he says I could be of great service to you to make you more comfortable—but this I leave altogether to your own judgement. If you want me to come out nothing shall prevent my doing so, but if you think it would be best to stay I will do that; whatever you think best I will do.

I am doing very well here. I am comfortably situated and am taking care of what we have here. I have written to you so often how I am doing that I think it is unnecessary to write again this time for fear you may not get the other letters. I will say that I have written to you for two hundred dollars. That is all I will ask you for while you are gone. It cost me that to go to housekeeping. I can now live cheaper than I would boarding, and take so much better care of the Negroes. Far would it be for me to give you any trouble or uneasiness on my account. I pray you have none, for I do assure you I doing well and I would not for any thing have you hurry home before you have got enough to do you some good. My advice to you is while there is any prospect to get what you went for not to give up the ship but preserve and do not on  my account hurry home until you get ready. I know very well that you have had everything to learn about the county, and I well know that you could not go there, green hands, as you were, and make a fortune in one year. So I say, give it a fair trial and if you want me there you have only to say so, for as I have ever done been ready to do what ever you though was best, I am still the same. You know it requires perseverance in anything to get along. Then, my dear husband, be cheerful and contented to keep trying while there is  any hope. As much as I would like to see you I would rather you would stay another year and come back with something than to come now with nothing.

None but God knows how dear you are to me. I love you so much more than I thought I could love anybody. We little know the strength of our love for anyone until we are separated from them. I can say in truth that without you, or the hope of seeing you again, I would not want to live. I have thought often and wondered how women that has lost their husbands could ever be as cheerful and happy as some of them are. Let me say to you, my precious husband—and believe me—that I have loved you so long and lived with you until your presence seems necessary almost to my existence, never having thought of having to live with out you. Oh, you have no idea, surely, how dear your are to me. If I ever get by your side again, nothing but death shall ever take me from it. Nothing of a small nature should ever trouble or vex me again for I know I will be the happiest being on earth just to be with you; it makes no odds in what circumstances, for I love you so much more than I do myself. You my darling, your sweet presence will be sufficient to make me happy the balance of my days. Oh nothing shall ever make me unhappy again if I should be fortunate enough to get with you and my child again, for you and him are my idols and I cannot, nor do I want to, help it. Notwithstanding all this, I now I have strength of mind enough to bear the separation if it is to be for our good—and I know it will be, for if it does nothing else it will make us satisfied when we get together even in no better circumstances. You know I have so much hope that I can and do look forward to the time with a good degree of cheerfulness. Then do the some and do not come until you are perfectly satisfied. You know I can bear anything that is to profit my child and you with fortitude. Then let us agree to sacrifice our feelings in this may as long as we have undertaken it with fortitude. I believe we will be blessed in it. Then let this cheer you and stimulate you to preserver. One year of the time has gone and the time will soon pass off. You could spend three or four years here and not think or see what you had done, and as many there in active business would count for something. You will feel so much better satisfied when it is over and you get home with something then you would have done if you had of stayed here and done nothing new. If you make but little you will be so much happier. You will have a clear conscience.

I am doing as well as I know how. I will now talk to you about other matters—Mary Larue got a letter today from his husband and he said that Charlie Osbourne had shot a man out there and said Charlie had been tried and cleared. I do hope you or John may never get into any such difficulty. I pray you try and avoid any such things.

Georgetown is pretty much as it was when you left. As for the church, it is getting on in the same way precisely. I wrote you on account of one protracted meeting we have had since you left, who joined and all about it. None of the other churches have had any big
meetings since you left. Badore Payrnes says to tell you he has not forgotten you. Everybody asks about you and seems to feel a deep interest in you. I do believe you endeared yourself to the pious people of this place before you left as much as any one ever did.

I do long for the time to come when you will get home and enjoy yourself once more, for I know you have friends here with whom you could enjoy yourself so much. Be patient and preserve and the time will soon pass off. Lewis Offutt and Mrs Pattersen marry tonight. The Saunders has bought a place within sixteen miles of Lexington, Missouri and a mile and half from Bob Keens’. They are very much pleased. The Holtzclaws leave here in a few weeks for Paducah, all of them. I will continue to write every Wednesday hereafter to you or John. You may rest assured I will not fail to do so every week until you get home again, be it long or short. I will close for the present. Write me often, my sweet husband.Farewell until next week when I will talk to you again, your loving and devoted wife until death,

M. Haun
