Dobson stayed all night for the purpose of going to Rich Bar[note]Consult the <a href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">map</a> for precise location.[/note] in the morning to see about a claim.

<strong>Monday 3</strong> - A clear beautiful day. Pa went to the Point early in the morning started with the res, Dobson and an old Dutchman named Goodshall. We got there about 11 o'clock. Crossed the river several times in a boat. Stayed all night at Shasta below the bar a piece. Played some on the violin for the first time since I left Marysville. Went around to all of the claims.

<strong>Tuesday 4</strong> - We bought an interest in a claim above the bar, the company paying 400$ for it. We started for the Point after dinner and arrived about the middle of the afternoon. The man came with us named Parish to get his pay due. Got some crystallized quarts on the road. Parrish stayed  all night with us.

All of them left for Rich Bar after dinner leaving me alone. They took some provisions with them. I went up to the ditch in the afternoon to see about the water. Stopped several holes and threw out a good many rocks. They paid Parish his money after breakfast and started him home. Nothing else today.
