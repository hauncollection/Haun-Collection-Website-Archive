<p style="padding-left: 210px;">Georgetown April 6th 65</p>

<div style="text-indent: 4em;">My dearest Friend</div>
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">Your letter of the 3rd is before</div>
me and will answer immediately. It took me somewhat
by surprise as I was hardly looking for it so soon
but I assure you the surprise was such as I like
very agreeable indeed. It found me well &amp; still at
cousin Jack Crumbaughs. I go to town very
seldom only on business or to the post office, as
town has but few charms for me at this time
Rube you are getting quite pretie of late your
cousins yard must be beautiful and the discrip
tion you give of it very refreshing to one that has
had the blues as long as I have so you must excuse
me as I said before if I do talk a little at random
sometimes. I am certain you would if you only
knew how unhappy I have been for sometime
Rube you ask me to burn your letter. This too is
rather singular as it the first request you ever
made of that kind &amp; the first you ever made that I have
any reluctance in granting to you some how
I have always felt bound to grant any request you
might ask of me excepting this. Please give me a little
time to consider it but in the mean time if you
desire it I pledge my honor no mortal eye but my
own shall ever scan its sacred pages, will that do in
the place of burning it. Storys wife is not dead but
Rum Payne is dead yesterday funeral to be prea
ched today at 10 00. I have not recvd a letter
from home since I have been here am uneasy ab
out my parents. Clay brewitt marries this week a
miss stone youngest son of Levi Brewitt not of age
yet her father is opposed to the match his father gives
him a splendid infair. I will probably see Dora
sunday evening &amp; will show her your letter, excuse
me I mean I will deliver your message (Rube this
is the first time you have ever displayed your colors
by word to use a military phrase. It is true I have
not been so blind as not to see you had some little
regard for your friend but thought as you did that
you never cared as much for me as I did for you
you could not help knowing I loved you. The thought
of posessing the love of one so pure &amp; angelic as Mollie
is truly gratifying. do not think I am trying to
flatter you for I am not I am very glad you are
enjoying youself so hugely I only hope it may com
time through life that no shadows may ever cross
your path to mar for one moment your enjoyment
is my sincere wish, would that I could add one
more flower to that wreath in your life which is call
ed pleasure how gladly would I do it, Rube be sure
you know my sentiments before you commit yourself
further. men are very uncertain these times. I shall
not leave without seeing you. you have such a cute
way of giving me a gentle rebuke I deserve it I suppose
in regard to dora quizzing me about an engagement
I know I have been talking at random but I know you
will forgive me wont you. I visited a cousin of mine
last sunday a sister of Lizzie Huste yougest one
she says she wants to got Cal with me to see her sister
Jim Crumbaugh also says he will got to Cal with me
this summer also Jim Beatty wont I have plenty
of company but I have not started yet Jim crumba
ugh has joined the baptist church. you say city life
has too many facinations for you. True it is a great place
for wickedness &amp; to corrupt the young &amp; innocent like your
self but I think Mollie can resist everything
of that kind &amp; will yet anchor in that harbor of safety
going to a circus I think no harm but not a very
suitable place for ladies. The company at such
places is generally inferior quality so you do no
worse than go to a circus I think your chances for
heaven pretty good. you used to make out you
were so very concientious you never would got with
me but to one &amp; that not exactly a circus but I thi
nk it ws only put on wanted me to think you
were very pious. I told dora you threw open your
arms &amp; came running to embrace me, she says
when you get to paguing her she will say well
I thought you would kiss without embracing
him if you did not your pa did. He thinks
more of me anyhow than you do I am primping
my mouth for a sweet kiss when you return can I have
it or not, I know you are opposed to it somethings I can
resist but I cannot resist those sweet pouting rosy lips
<div style="text-indent: 4em;">I imagine I hear you say you imprudent rascal</div>
of Rubes. Must close I cannot write a long letter eve
ry time answer this soon &amp; tell me when you are coming
home good bye as wever your friend &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c
Please excuse envelop        J.J.H
