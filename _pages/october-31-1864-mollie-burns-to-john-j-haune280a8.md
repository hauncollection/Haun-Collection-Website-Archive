Kind Friend,

I did not receive your letter until the 25th although it was written on the 16th. The ring arrived safe with the letter. I can wear it, but it is rather too small. You have forgotten, I guess, that my  hand, like myself, has its usual share of flesh. Two years is sufficient time to forget such trivial matters in. I prize it very highly, think it very pretty.

Dora is in Henry County[note]Georgia[/note] but we hear from her often. She has quite a nice little school of 30 scholars. It is out the last of November. I am going down and then we are going to Louisville as we were disappointed this summer in not getting there.

Mrs Kershaw and Mrs Bonner, formerly Miss Laura Heady was to see me on Saturday. Laura has married quite a fine looking man with plenty of cash. She came over dressed very fine, with a splendid horse and buggy of her own. She lives just 7 miles from Danville. Just imagine you hear Charles Hatten give a long sigh. I think from Dora’s letters she also meditates something rather strange, from the way she speaks of a certain one of the male sex.

I met with Mrs Webb at our church last night. We have a new preacher, quite an intelligent and pleasant man. Mrs Webb thinks him superior to any since Noland.

You speak of spending another winter in Camp Chase. I should call on someone to make endeavors to release you first. I expect Mr John Lemon will be released. His friends drew up a petition here, and sent it to Washington on his behalf. Johnnie Barkley shot himself, but it is just a flesh wound.
