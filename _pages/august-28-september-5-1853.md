Mo 5            He is not ded yet but is thou
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">ght cannot live. The miners are
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">trying the man for shooting.[note]This incident was also described by Fariss and Smith (pg 210 - 211). A couple by the name of Gilson kept a boarding house on Henpeck Flat. In the fall of 1853, Mrs Gilson ran away with one of their boarders, a Mr. Wilson. A few days later, the abandoned Gilson caught sight of his wife and her lover through a window, seated on together on a sofa. Enraged, he strode up to the window and shot the man inside, in full view of his boarders. A meeting of the miners was called, and nearly a thousand men gathered; jury, judge and clerk were selected, a trial held and Gilson acquitted. The victim, Wilson, survived the incident, and, after his recovery, left the region. Mrs Gilson returned to her home in Michigan for a time, but later reunited with her husband.[/note]We are trying a new place today
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">for gold.</span></span></span>
