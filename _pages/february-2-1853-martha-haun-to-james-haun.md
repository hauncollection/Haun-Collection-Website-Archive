<span style="margin-left: 480px;">February 2 1853[note]Miss dated. If it was indeed a year ago that James departed, this letter was written in 1854.[/note]</span>

My Dear Husband,

It was one year ago yesterday morning since I bade you adieu and saw you depart for California. Yesterday was a very different day from the one you started on—you know there was a little snow that day and it will ever be remembered by me. Now the weather is beautiful, and has been for ten days past. The days are more like the last of March than the first of February.

I am well and hearty, and you never saw anything grow like Lizzie. She is growing handsome she will make a beautiful woman. She is so much admired I fear it will spoil her. She is sprightly and interesting far more so than girls of her age generally are.

The negroes are doing well. Kit is as fat as she can be again. Her child is walking. Bit’s child Nat is beginning to walk. He has never been sick in his life and is decidedly the finest child of his age she has ever had. Jim grows faster than he ever did. Him and Nelson grow very fast, but I don’t see that Wash grows any. Jim is more than a head taller than Wash—

I do sincerely hope this may find you and my and my darling child in the enjoyment of good health and good spirits, and doing well.

We had some shooting[note]This incident is also discussed in Lizzie's letter of February 1854 available <a title="February 1854" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/version-iii-series-ii/february-1854-lizzie-hurst-haun-to-james-haun/">here</a>.[/note] here last week on the street between Jimmy Robinson[note]Possibly a relative of Governor James F. Robinson of Gerogetown.[/note] and Al Hines, a young man that had been expelled from the Kentucky Military Institute. His parents live in Bardstown. The two fell out about Ellen Finnell—some very trivial affair. Jimmy Robinson had been cutting round Ellen for some time, just as Bert Johnson did with Betty Holtzclaw. When Hines come he cut around drunk nearly all the time and would take E. out a-riding and go in debt for his buggy. That was what Jimmy would not do—go out riding with her. So it was that Hines got drunk and dogged Jimmy all day for a fight and later in the evening Hines put his hand in his pocket to get his pistol and found he had none, but in his attempt to shoot Jimmy fired at him twice. One ball grazed the skin barely, while the other entered the body. He was taken into Dr. Barlow’s office with the blood streaming though his vest and it was the impression of all he would die immediately. They telegraphed forthwith to his farther. Doctors Sutton and Barlow succeeded in stopping the blood, though they could not find the ball. The next morning they succeeded in finding it and he is now out of danger.

Jimmy was tried and cleared. No one blamed him for it; he tried to avoid Hines all day. H. was very drunk and Jimmy cared nothing about E.

Hines sent for Ellen directly after he was shot. She went down and cried about him awhile. Next morning he sent for her again and was moved up there. He is there yet. It has been a very ridiculous affair all together.

Tell John that Frank Rankin had a long talk with me yesterday evening on my steps. He says if he could get the money to take him out there he would start tomorrow morning. He said he tried to get money to go with you all out there but could not do it. He says he may stay here until he dies of old age and never have anything. He says he is determined to leave here.

Tell John to persevere. Everybody says he has taken a wise course. I send you in this a paper from Clint West. You will understand it it is something about that matter of H.P.‘s.

O, how often do I think of you. I never go to church but I think of you all the time. I almost fancy sometimes I see that black head of yours sitting over there where you always sat—but one year of time is gone and I begin to brighten up with the hope of seeing you again. I would not have you come back now, after you and I have both suffered so much, until you get something to come with or feel well assured you never can make anything there. But do not be easily discouraged. Everybody seems to wish you success.

R.E. West says you must come back and settle here near the church. She says the church does not want to let you go away to settle anywhere else. You seem to have a great many friends here and I do believe you have. The course you pursued for a year before you left endeared you to the most respectable portion of the community here very much, and I do hope you will get able to come back and settle ourselves here comfortably and enjoy ourselves in our church and with our friends. Hope on, hope ever—the time will soon pass off.

I am doing the very best I can and I think I am doing pretty well considering. You know I have no dependents but Sam. The boys are too small to hire for much and the woman are having children so fast that they are of but little use for any thing else. I am now situated so I can save and do much better than I could boarding. It would not do at all to board and let the negroes live as they was when you left. I saw I would have heavy doctor bills to pay for the children and more than likely loose some of them unless I took them under my own care. It will not do to let negroes manage for themselves. They will do no good for themselves, or anyone else.

I will want two hundred dollars and then I can do, I think, until you get back. Please send me that much. Write to me as often as you can, for it is the greatest pleasure I have to get a letter from either of you. Farewell my dears, while I remain, your loving wife,

M. Haun

I send you the minutes of our state meeting and the Herald.[note]The <em>Georgetown Herald[/note]</em> Bet is in here and says tell you and John howdy for her. Clark is married to some girl in Paris—
