Mr Haun,

There has been mules gone from here since you left to Gibsonville. Hence we have had no chance of going, as we could not go alone on foot. If you can come over we will try and walk it as they tell me here there is chance for mules to get through.

I am more than anxious to get home. Tell John if we do not get home before Christmas eve he must come over if he can possibly get here. There is to be a large ball here and I want him to come if he can get here. Do come and try and get us home if there is any possible chance for it. If we cannot go at all you had better try and get here and we had better rent a room and do our own cooking. It would save enquires.

I am in a great hurry as there is some men just a going to start on foot to Nelson Creek and will take this note. I have not seen them but some man told me at diner about their going over and said if I would write a few lines they would take it for me.

We are well.

Haun

Do make haste and come, you and John. I want to see you so bad.       - L.
