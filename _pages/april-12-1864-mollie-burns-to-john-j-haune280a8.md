Dear Friend,

I have taken my pen this morning up to write again and sincerely hope I may proceed without interruption. Yesterday, just as I had collected my writing materials Will Lroyman drove up with some of our relations from Missouri, a Mr Jackson. They spent the day. Consequently my letter had to be postponed, as on several occasions before.

We have nothing new on hand to relate in the way of news, excepting Billie F. and Gabbie H. are  to be married today week. They are going to spend a few days in Cincinnati. Mrs F. intends giving them a little entertainment when they return. They contemplate boarding with her, I suppose, as Pa has been fitting up a room there.

Billie Page was up yesterday and told me that Gabbie wished him to remain to attend the wedding, but business prevented. The reformers are holding a protracted meeting conducted by Card have had some LD auditions. The Baptists commenced their spring campaign on Sunday last. Our meeting closed on Sunday night after a continuation of five weeks. A great many members of our church went up to Mrs Moody’s to sit till bedtime with the preachers before they left us. I had quite a nice escort in the person a very interesting young minister. I never laughed as much in all my life. I told him I had often heard it said that Methodist preachers could tell the hardest yarns gotten up, but never knew the correctness of the statement before.

Barnie S. and Jennie Winter are to be married next week also. But from marriages to death—old man Hall is dead. Rumor says he left Mrs Webb but four thousand dollars and bequeathed his residence to Mrs Adam, his niece, and her son $2,500. He has made a great many divisions of his wealth. He died as he lived, concerning himself with his worldly matters. Manulius Johnson is also dead.

Jessie McConnell and Tom Martin spent Sunday week with me. Jessie expects to start for California the latter part of this month. He is coming to bid me goodbye, he says, as I won’t go with him. He says he thinks I might as well go with one person as another, but as it is best to say some, and leave some, I will not give you my reply.

I was thinking if we should ever meet again, and you should haul out some of my last two or three letters on me, I should be taken with a sudden desire to leave, or blush considerably. But your good heart, in consideration of modesty, would spare me, I hope.
Mike Barlow arrived here on furlough to have his eye operated on. He has a cataract growing on it. Several prisoners were brought in this morning: some of the Bager’s boys, Jimmie Cantrill, not Ness’ brother, but his cousin becoming tired of Canada tried to make their way through but failed. Johnnie S. just flies around as he pleases. Eaf is in Dixie. He went round by water and is now with General John H Morgan.[note]John Hunter Morgan is best known for Morgan’s Rain in 1863, when he role over 1,000 miles from Tennessee, through Kentucky and Indiana, to Ohio. He surrendered July 26 near Salineville, Ohio, but he managed to escape, with some of his officers the following November. By 1864 he was again raiding into Kentucky, but with less success.[/note]

But to tell you of a correspondence I am carrying on, I received a letter from Rock Island from a Mr John H Collins requesting a correspondence. I never heard tell of him before. He is a Mississippian. I consented provided he would not criticize. His letters are very well worded and prettily written, and anything for a novelty. I wrote asking by what means he got possession of my address.

And your friend is married, well such is life! War, although full of its horrors, has not complete sway over all. You tell me you have been in prison eight months, and Camp Chase at that. The name seems to be expressive of horror and suffering. Would that it was in my power to assist you, but such being not the case, I can only give you my warmest sympathy, which is but poor comfort. It is pleasant to think, although prison doors are shut upon us, that shall there are some friends that are ever mindful of us. It seems as though peace will never be restored for you Rebels are about to be as impertinent and troublesome here as when all you boys left us.[note]Nathan Bedford Forrest was raiding Kentucky during the spring of 1864, beginning with the attack at Fort Anderson on March 25, through the middle of April. When this letters was written, the confederate troops had just regrouped in Tennessee following a furlough, and on April 14 Abraham Buford would again lead a raid of Fort Anderson at Forrest’s instruction.[/note]

Sallie Dougherty has been up visiting but has now gone home. It is now striking twelve. I wonder what you are driving at, a good dinner. I guess not, but you can appreciate good living more when you are released, if such ever be the case. I wish you were here to come up and sit with me till bedtime. I have been going to meting so much that I shall be lost, and then I have got so much to tell you about that has happened since you left. I often think of the evenings we have spent together in times that are past and gone. You say that I would not know you. I think you are mistaken. I should be very sure to know you. I guess you are sporting a suit of whiskers, as shaving is not always convenient, especially in prison. The sun first shines, and then it rains. It is a true April day, so much like my thoughts—sometimes all sunshine, as it were, and then all gloomy and dark, it seems, as midnight. But I should not write of gloomy thoughts to you, but rather try and cheer you, for you, I suppose, have your share of them.

But I must close, paper being exhausted. I sincerely hope we may have the pleasure of seeing you in Georgetown before long. Write soon.

Your friend –as ever,

Mollie C Burns

I send you as much of that article you sent me as you desire. How much is that?
