Robbin Ruff

The best wish you could leave take
my word Robbin Ruff twould scarce
find you in bread or in bear be honest
and be true and say what would you
do, if you had but a thousand a year
Robbin Tuff if you had but a thous
and a year__ But its when you
are aged and gray Robbin Ruff and the
day of your death it draws nigh say
what with your pain would you do
with your gain if you had but a
thousand a year Robbin Ruff if
you had but a thousand a year
Thereâ€™s a place that is better than this
Robbin Ruff and I hope in my heart
you may go there where the poor mans
as great though he had no estate Age
as if he had but a thousand a year
Robbin Ruff if you had a but a
thousand a year
