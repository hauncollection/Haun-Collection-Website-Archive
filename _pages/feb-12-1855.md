My Dear loved husband-

I comence this letter
with the faint hope that you will get it some time
or other owing to the deep snows that has fallen
out here in this Western county we have had
but few mailes recently. the cars having been
stoped or nearly entirely so by the snows. I
should have gone home by this time had the cars
been running to day it is raining slowly &amp;
melting the snow a way. I suppose it will all be
gone by morning. I can get home in four days
from here on the cars &amp; will start in the course
of a week I dread the trip it makes me sick to
travel on them it affects me like sea sickness
&amp; I vomit like a sick child but stop vomiting as
soon as I get off of them but do not get over the
effects for several days. billy G says he is going
to give me some of his double distilled Whiskey to take
home with me for you when you come. I will take
good care of it for you &amp; hope it will not be long
until you tap the cask in old Ky &amp; drink a toast
to your loving &amp; devoted wife &amp; after the toast give her
one long &amp; loving embrace. Oh what a happy day to me will
that be but now I am anticipating a gain &amp; when ever
I get to thinking that way a bout you I get so impatient
for that day to arrive that I scarcely know how to
pass the time but I must try to wait the best I can
billy G works hard &amp; has as little satisfaction with it
as any man I ever say he has surely been more
cursed in marrying than any man I ever saw shears
it better- he is verry kind to me &amp; treats me like
a sister he took me out on yesterday to see the country
there is some beautiful country here &amp; some a gain
pretty rough. Sant has a verry pretty place he is
now offering it for seak he asks six thousand dollars
for it. I asked him what he was going to do or where
going he said he did not know that he was tired staying
here that he would like to live in New Orleans
or Lexington Ky. John Graves talks of leaving the
country Jane has such poor health here they think the
climate is two cold or her. I told John to hold on
until you come back that probably you would
go to a New country &amp; we could go to gather-
I wrote to John sometime a go &amp; told John what
Sant said a bout billy G &amp; cautioned him a bout
lending him money should he make applications
for it but this keep to your selves do not tell
HP any thing a bout it billy said he was going
to write to you in a few days, WG gets up of a
morning &amp; makes a fire in the kitchen &amp; brings up two
buckets of water fills up the tea kettle makes a fire in
the dining room &amp; one in his wifes room &amp; then comes
up stairs &amp; calls Pauline &amp; makes a fire in my
room Pauline gets the breakfast &amp; some times Nancy gets
up time enough for breakfast but more frequently
does not get up until the balance of us are all
done eating than any other way. Oh it makes me
feel like if ever I have it in my power to wait
on you &amp; make you comfortable again it would
be such a pleasure to me to do it. Jane says that
I ahve done more work this winter since I have
been here than Nancy has done in five years
She hires a girl to come to the hous to sew &amp; she
does less work than any other woman I ever saw in my
life in any circumstances.... John said in his
letter that he had almost forgotten every thing he ever
knew oh how sorry it maks me to think of him
now in his young days buried in those mines
deprived of every thing like enjoyment or society
when his feelings are young &amp; he naturly want
society &amp; could enjoy it to be so totally deprived
of it so hard it is hard on him at his age to live as
he has to there. I so much fear it will crush his
spirits &amp; make an old man of him in feelings
before he is hardly a man at all but you are
with him &amp; can see the effect it has upon
his mind &amp; you are his farther U must surely
love him as well as I do &amp; I will have to let
you be the judge of how long you keep him
there I do not think he is happy he writes
two much like a man of nature yeares &amp;
like one that has felt &amp; known disappointment
&amp; sorrow oh if I could only see him happy
if I could only have him with me &amp; try
to make him happy it would be some
comfort to me I want to see you both
God only knows how much I some times
think you may forget me or become in
diferent a bout me but know if you do
it is more than I ever can be to you &amp; do
not I beg you let y darling child forget
me... tell me in your next letter if you have
set any time to start home &amp; if you have when
it is-- you must not come unexpectedly but
let me know when to look for you so as not
to excite me two much &amp; when you get to
New York or New Orleans you must Tele
graph me from there so as to let me know
when to look for you. you have been there
two years &amp; have not said a word yet
a bout coming now I think it is time you
would say something a bout it-----
WG says he feares you may not your
gold safe home what you do make
he says there is some of the Eastern
cheeks that are not good, but he says
you will know best whehter to
ship it or sell it---

I will write to you as soon as I get
home &amp; let you know how I find
the folks there so you may look
for a letter the next mail after you
get this.. the church is getting a
long as it did when you left not much
change any way, Jerry Stevens has
moved to Lexington to keep boarding
house-----

now I must a gain say good
by- oh how much oftener will I
have it to write. Jane &amp; John Graves
&amp; all the kin send there love to you &amp;
John. farewell farewell my sweet
husband &amp; darling child. I remain
your loving &amp; devoted wife until death
<p style="padding-left: 180px;">M Haun</p>

but I will have to keep them until you
come---
