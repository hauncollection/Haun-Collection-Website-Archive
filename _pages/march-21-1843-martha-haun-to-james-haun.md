Dear husband,

I have this moment received your second letter, I was truly glad to hear of your good health and spirits. The rest of the connections, myself and family are well.

We are at Dr. McClarth’s. I will make this place my home until your return. We have had the coldest weather I have ever seen in the south, since you left. On the 24th of this month, snow fell 11 inches deep. This morning was a little pleasant—the first pleasant morning we have had in a long while. We have begun to think something about Miller’s prediction: the unusual weather, the large comet, the shining stars, the lunar rainbow, &amp;c have put us to thinking.

My dear husband, I have but very little news to write you, having written all about our business in my last letter. I think we have done as well or better with the business as I expected. Mc has sold all the wood at one dollar and two bits[note]A 'bit' is a historical unit of currency equal to 15 cents. The price of wood was therefore $1.25 a cord.[/note] a cord and says he will have every dollar of your money for you by the time you come down. I have not been to a notary public yet, on account of the weather, but will go this week. Mrs Bedford will send for me tomorrow, and I will go before I return to town.

Dr. McClarth is very much a gentleman. The more I am acquainted with him the better I like him. He and the family are very kind to me and John; I could not be treated better in my own Mother’s house.

But, my dear, I am getting very anxious to see you. Do come down as soon as you can. Your darling little boy wants to see you too. He is out this evening with the gentleman a-shooting birds---

I do feel so anxious to get up there and get settled once more, that I do hope you will not let me wait for you any longer than is actually necessary.

I will close. Give my love to my dear old Mother and sister Jane and tell them they do not know what a pleasure it is to me to know that I will soon be near them. Give my love to your brothers and sisters, and all inquiring friends, and remember that my fond heart will ever remain the same to you, until it ceases to throb in this bosom. Farewell my best beloved. Let me entreat you once more to come to me as soon as possible, remember your loving,

Martha Haun
