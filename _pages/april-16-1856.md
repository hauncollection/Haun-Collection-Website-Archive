Georgetown Ky April 16th 1856
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">My dear Sir,</p>

<div style="text-indent: 6em;">Your very welcome favor of the 15th of
December last was received sometime to February whilst I
was in Frankfort discharging my legislative duties. My en
gagement at the time and other presing duties since my re
turn home, have prevented me until the present moment how pre-
forming the very agreeable duty of acknowledging its receipt
together with dead enclosed. for your promptness and attention
to complying with my request you are untitled to my thanks and
gratitude. The deed was property acknowledged and is now
of heard in one office, which winds up finally so far as I
am concerned you act as Adams Guardian He?. For my sep
posed obligations you may fal under to me pa having been one
of your endorsers, you are fuly released. Having confidence in your
integrity and uptightness as a gentleman, and knowing you to
be my friend, I was willing to serve you. I wish all whom
I have befriended in a similar way had been as faithful. __
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">I know you are not a man of much literary pre-
tension, but I must do you the justice of saying Mat I have
janly? we received a letter which interested me more theres
yours. It was truth, yet it was invested with a desire of
romance Mat made it deeply interesting. We ladies must in-
deed have had a hard time of it. I was forcibly reminded whitel
reading your narative of the scenes one pioneer mother went
through in the early settlement of Kentucky. __
During the past year my hearth was very bad and for months
neither I or my friends considers my recovery at all curtain.
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">But thanks to a good and merciful God I am now very much
better, though I am not yet as stout as desirable or as when
you last saw me.
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">I have, strange and may appear to you, concluded to remove
to norther Illinois or Iowa__ I have not yet fully determined
and with that view I am now offering to sale my farm.
If I do not tell privately I intend to offer it at public sale in
Sept next__ short health and life he spare me. My mother is
to do a banking business and to operate in real estate.
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">My family is growing so rapidly that I feel it to be my duty
to go where I will be able to do more for them than I can ever
hope to do for them there. __
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">This past winter was scour thaw ever was known in this
region before; the oldest inhabitant has no recollection of anything
like it. The thermometer stood to waks below zero and sometimes
so degrees below that point. I see froze 18 inches thick on the rivers.
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">In consequence of he severe winter, the spring is very backwards
Man of the farmes are not done breaking hemp and my little
corn planted. __
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">Money is abundant and most things very high. I and and negroes
are very high; mules and horses are higher then they ever were before
in this state; hogs also high; cattle low and dull; corn dull an
more abundant than it has been at this season of the year than
I almost ever saw it; hemp $6. 59/100 cash, but has been as high as $88.
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">So you see pen this seale of prices that one farmers are pios
persons.
Georgetown is getting along about after the old fashion. Oc-
casionally a dog-fight  or some other trivial thing happens to
kick up an excitment. This however soon papers away and then
everything is as dull as ever.
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">I suppose you heard of the marriage of Dickenson. He went
off last November driving a small revival. His old flame,
Miss Jane Leathers, proved the [congleerer?].
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">Green Tucker lost his wife about ten days ago. She died
of typhoid fever. To sickness that I knew of. The winter
and spring so far has been very healthy.
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">The old kind Gen. Preatt is doing rather badly with his
house. Clint West has taken the other house which has wellnigh
taken all the Gen’s custom.
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">But Thompson is country Lude since the death of Finnell
He is as fat and lazy as ever. The old coon has got “sorta
galish,”__
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">I am glad to hear that you and brothers are all
doing so well. Hope you will all make fortunes and come back
to old Ky to live as I hope to do when I move to Iowa.
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">Present my respects to Mrs Haun and the balance
of the family and to all of your brothers. Tell Henry P he must
write to me- that I still remember him in great kindness
Excuse this serapy sort of letter. I have written you such
items as I thought would interest you and just as they occured to me.
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">Write to me soon &amp; often. Your letters always interst me.
May Peace, Happiness &amp; Prosperity attend you and yours through life.</div>

Mr James H. Haun
