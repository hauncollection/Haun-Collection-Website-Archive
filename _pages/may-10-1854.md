<p style="padding-left: 210px;">May the 10th 1854</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My own Sweet husband--</p>
                    I received a letter
from you last Sunday week dated March the 18th
&amp; one from John on the same day of date March
the fifth &amp; oh what a pleasure to hear that
you were both well &amp; hearty &amp; to handle
the same paper that your dear hands had
handled. I considered the last good news
although you live lonely &amp; rough yet you are
well &amp; making money &amp; I assure you that is
not the most unpleasant life we can live
in this world besides we are looking for
ward to better days. you do not know how
I have bouyed up my spirits this spring think
ing that this sumer you will make enough
to come home with next winter. I have situa
ted my self as comfortable for this year as I
can possibly he with you a way. I had written
you in an other letter that I have the house intire
ly to my self since the first of March &amp; took
Tompson Finnell &amp; his wife to board with
me &amp; the dentist is a day boarder so I have three
boarders &amp; Finnell is verry accommodating
the nigroes are all hired out except bet &amp;
Sam. I have enough for company &amp; enough to
keep me busy. I do not know how I could
do any better than I am doing under the cir
cumstances. I do assure you I leave nothing un
done that I can do for the credit &amp; wellfare
of my self &amp; family in the wright I will
perservere if my mind is spared me to the last
day of my life oh there is such a satisfaction
in doing wright that I would not vary from
it if I knew it for all this world could give
I mean in matters of importance--
Dave is stil down a mong the Loyds. I got
a letter from him not long since saying
that he had got to ploughing &amp; his health was
improving. The kin are all well Mr Moore
&amp; liz was in last Sunday. Liz has Joined
the Presbyterian church. Mrs Mitchel
has been to see me two or three times she
broke the ice her self for friendship. The
sewing society has been meeting at my house
for two months or more. I refused to join
&amp; they said they would keep it there until I
Joined. I told them under the circumstances
to put my name down for I was tired
of them it was not convienent at all
times to have them oh how I think of
you every time I go to do any thing in my
garden of how you used to work in the old
garden--- in the morning I set down
a gain to finish this letter I commenced it last
knight. I have just got a letter from Dave
this morning. his health is improving he was at
Dick Loyds when he wrote but makes Dave
Loyds his home he says he has written to
you &amp; to HP lately he says he has not got
money to come to Georgetown if he wished &amp; he
says down there is as good a place to study law
as any where else &amp; he will commence it verry
soon... Mr Hands school has just started out
to the woods to have a picnic. I have been fixing
lizze &amp; standing on the corner Mrs Web &amp; my self
all the morning to see them march out there has
a great many gone all my family but my self I
did not feel well enough to go to day. Frank
Rankin come down &amp; offered to take me in a buggy
&amp; so did Tom Burbradge &amp; several others but I went
last year &amp; got so tired I would not go this time-
liz looked verry pretty she is growing verry fast &amp; is verry
interesting she is going to make a smart pretty woman
you have no idea how much she is admired
she talks a bout you &amp; John so often she loves
her uncl better than any boddy else living she often
says she dont get any petting since her uncl left
she says you are the only one that ever petted her
any in her life. when ever I talk of going to Calafornia
she says she will go if she has to run off &amp; if ever I
should go there I am bound to take her for she is left
in such a situation that we will have to take care of
her or force her from us &amp; that I cannot nor will
not do so she had as well or better have no farther
than to have one to do as her does he has never
written one line to any one of us since he left last
fall &amp; he does not seem to care any thing for his
children: they would be better of if he was dead for
he is doing no good upon earth &amp; I would not be
surprised at any time to hear of his death. I never
will give liz up to any one one earth until she
marries if I have to divide the dress on my
back with her so where ever I go she goes for no
one else has she to care for her but me &amp; I am detor
minded to keep her with me until she leaves me wi
llingly &amp; that will never be I well know until she marries
she is all my comfort now. I have none other but
her &amp; them she loves her dear uncle so much more
than she does her farther or any other man living-
never will I forget the Weeks they have all been so kind to
me. the Dr Mrs Web &amp; Will all say they are a going to
do every thing they can to get you to go South when you
come back from calafornia. the Dr is down there now
he has bought out his brothers interest &amp; has it all to him
self now. oh my sweet I am as I have ever been
ready to obey your wishes or commands so any thing you
may grant me to do you have but to say it &amp; it will be done
Just make your calculations &amp; arraignments
to suit your self &amp; they shal suit me but I do
hope we will see each other before this time
next year either here or in calafornia-
our church is like warm at present &amp; has been for
a long time we have been trying to raise money
enough to paint it all over a gain it kneeds it
verry much we have got nearly enough to do it
