<strong>Sunday 1</strong> - Rained off and on all day and night. I stayed at the ranch all forenoon and started home after dinner and got as far as the Illinois Ranch. I saw H. Bray, he told me were absent a hand at Massack.  I went back to Quincy before night and stayed all night. Ma and Lizzie called on Mrs Bass after supper. Nothing else worthy of notice.

<strong>Monday 2</strong> - I hired a man by the name of Riddle. I rode a horse that Sterling had brought over to Quincy. I rode as far as the Illinois Ranch and then took it afoot home. Arrived at home about noon got in company with Butts. I found some men using our boxes and water in the ravine above the ranch. I got dinner and prospected O’Gradys ravine again but only got the color. I went to the Point and then to Rocky Bar and staid all night. I found Butts there trying to borrow money.

<strong>Tuesday 3</strong> - I went to work with the boys in the lower claims getting ready for washing. Lem and I sluiced off some dirt and rocks I worked in Jim Shults’ place he having a sore hand and ankle. Dave Haun came home from Rabbit Creek about supper time with a new pipe it cost $30. Nothing else today.

We raised out boxes about two feet to get clear of the tailings. We got ready for washing. Dave got a letter from H.P. Nothing else today.

<strong>Friday 6</strong> - Lem and I went to raising the troughs higher that run from the reservoir to the penstalk, and caulking them. A tree fell across the big flume and cut it in two and broke it. In the evening above the Point we put a blast in a big log that lay on the bank but it did not burst it so we rolled it down the hill and set fire to it. Dave sewed some old hose on the gum we commenced piping after dinner but soon quit. Dave took the pipe to the Point got it riveted. It was coming apart at the hose. Lem and I finished putting old hose on 50 feet of ground while Dave and Kyler made a box for the lower end. Very windy and cloudy late in the evening. Dave bought a keg of butter and some nails--butter 70 lbs.

<strong>Saturday 7</strong> - Did not pipe in the forenoon, the flume being broke above the Point. We ground our axes &amp;c. We piped all afternoon. Kyler and I went to where old Frank worked to see if we could get some old hose to cover the gum but we did not.
