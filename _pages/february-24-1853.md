Sam is breaking himp &amp; betty &amp; the children
are doing well. Kitty is doing well &amp; seem
satisfied with her home. Wish is with me
yet Pratt does not charge me any thing for
his board I found it would be a hard matter
for me to get wood &amp; water if I had to depend
on there negroes. So I concluded to keep him
with me until after bettys confinement &amp; hire
him out to take Jim if I stay in town but
I donot think I shal stay much in town this
summer, lizze is also with me. I could not
part from her two. Mr Moore told me to
keep her a while until I felt like I could
give her up. I think her &amp; me will both
go to the country &amp; spend the most of our
time after bet gets a bout. my friends
are verry kind to me. they come to see me Mrs
Johnson has been several times &amp; Bled &amp; his
wife Bled says he will come for any time &amp;

deal of harm til him I read his letter &amp; kissed it
&amp; water it with my tears. I will pray for him
&amp; you &amp; pray &amp; hope that we will meet again--
there seems to be so much interest manifested

was in court day. Will was married last thurs
day to Mary F Houston daughter of Steve she is
a bout sixteen &amp; verry pretty so say the people
I have not seen her nor did I know he was married
until he told me when he was here- he broug
ht the buggy at ninety nine dollars on four
months credit. Rose come to see me two or
three times a bout the selling of it &amp; discour
aged me verry much a bout getting much
for it. I rather suspected him for wanting
it for some one, &amp; I told him I would not
take less tan a hundred for it I got George
Toppas &amp; Mr Moore to have it bid up to that
&amp; it came in one dollar of it. Jim Nutter
or Will would have got it for fifty if they
could, Pratt thinks it was well sold with
out any harness-- I have paid Newbold
I have not collected any money yet---
Sam Thompson has got back from MO
he makes out that after examining the Pen
a tenteary he would not have it this is
what I have heard I have not seen him since
he got back he does not get it, - Bled
told me a trick he payed on General
Johnson to get money to take him out to
Mo. he went to Johnson &amp; told him he
had a fine lot of hemp &amp; if he would
advance him two hundred dollars that he mig
ht have hemp enough to satisfy him for it
Johnson sent his over seer to look at the
hemp &amp; he come back &amp; said the hemp was
there but when they went to hall it it
was piled up on boxes &amp; one thing or another
to make the house look pretty full when
there was scarcely a hundred dollars worth
there. Bled plauges the General a great
deal a bout Sam, so you see he is
Just where he started only with a little
worse name if possible-- Bled says he
will make him pay me. I donot know
how it will be-- Nat Saunders &amp; Gabe
has got back &amp; preparing to go to house
keeping fourth with on the Harman place
Mrs Saunders is staying with betty at
Owensborough they will settle there---
Clint is fixing up the old house &amp; moving
to it--- Ben Hall is selling out at cost
&amp; is going to move to Covington-- John
Lemon &amp; Miss betty Jenkins is to be married
next thursday morning so says Mary Larue
we had a business meeting last saturday
but as usual not much done they tried
to do some thing with Ridsdale but they cou
ld not make him understand any thing he cried
&amp; went on like a deranged man they had to
drop the case Harvey Graves then got up &amp;
started a conversation he had had with Finnell
then Jeffy got up &amp; puffed &amp; believed a bout
his character being unimpeachable &amp; he
defied any one to say ought a gainst his char
acter that he could &amp; would prove as good
a one as any man, they have appointed a
committee of ten to wait on him &amp;
Finnell- the other case of the child he
will plead guilty &amp; ask forgiveness so
think some that have talked with him
a bout it. I assure you he is verry low
in the estimation of this community---
tell dear Dave I am thankful to him for his
mineature that liz &amp; I kissed often &amp; shed
our tears to gather over it. oh ti seemed to bring
him back to us a gain tell him I will cherish
it as a dear loved one while I live- my

I go for this world is a blank with out you

to part from them, but excercise your own Judge
ment &amp; I will be governed by it you will I know
