<p style="padding-left: 180px;">Cumberland Ohio May 25th 64</p>

<div style="text-indent: 4em;">  Mr Haun</div>
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">Your letter arrived safely last Saturday and</div>
with it my ring. You shall be pardoned for delay this time
But you are right about disappointments &amp; had expected
your letter a week sooner and as I turned from the Office with
out it if you might have seen a shadow of disappointment on
my face thinking perhaps my letter had failed to reach you
or that you had been exchanged which would have been hard
ed with much more interest than my letter. Of course I will
accept your ring as a token of “friendship” and will prize it
very highly you do not know how much. I think of it &amp; I
so admire your task it being the prettiest of the kind I ev
er saw just my taste plain and neat. I wear with it two
plain gold rings and with each one of them there is consi
derable of romance connected one friend is no more, while another
is in Libby prison and yet another in Camp Chase. Don’t
you think my “friends are scattered like roses in bloom”
I am affraid my thoughtless and ill timed remarks concern
ing yourself and family, may have hurt your feelings, if so
I am very sorry and hope you will forgive me, won’t you just when
you wished to present the ring it was enough to wound any ones
feelings especially if they are sensative like myself I do not doubt
that you are in every respect worthy of my friendship and will
judge you accordingly should we ever meet I could not under
any circumstances greet you as a friend for such as been
the effect of our romantic correpondence Though years should pass
and I might be wearing caps you would still see on my finger
the ring presented by JJ Haun I do and think you would be hon
ored with a history of your life as I have come to the conclusion to take
your word for it and thank God and good parents that I too have a
character unstained and could you look in my heart you might
know I have no cause to be ashamed of anything cherished there,
or my past life. But I had to laugh when you defended yourself
about the flattery so well, presure? I will ahve to accept it as due praise
and “no fakery” I agree with you there are few persons who do not
have some dark moments if I had never been taught to feel for
those in affliction I might be as sad sometimes but this terri
ble war is enough to depress anyones spirits. I know you think
how sorry I am for you and wish I could be permitted to make your
prison life less wearysome or acknowledge your kindness in some
other way than thanks But there are no circumstances in which we
be placed but still we might be placed in worse while thousands
are falling every day and making hearts and homes desolate you

[re] get spared for no doubt some wise purpose Perhaps soon to return to your home.
I hope so and hope you will never enter the Rebel Army again yet
very many others think they are right no doubt I have just returned
from taking a horseback ride my chief source of enjoyment but
without a beaux as good ones are scarce the best being gone to the army.
Do you ever get anything interesting to read in Camp Chase
I will send you some papers if they will be accepted Oh did my
last letter go unpaid if so I shall feel deeply mortified I was just
out of stamps but gave a little boy money to pay postages and a dime for
taking it to the office. Mr Floid told me he recieved no money
and the letter went unpaid but he is always teasing me so, I should
feel very bad to know any letter would go to a prisoner without
a stamp it was no fault of mine if it did
