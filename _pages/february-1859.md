<strong>Tuesday 1</strong> - Very windy yesterday morning. It blew down two trees on Dean’s premises, and half a tree in the American Hotel backyard--and on the new fence, too. Still stormy and very wet under foot.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Our potatoes are frozen. Duesler and I sorted three sacks. He gets the frozen ones. Later I made and baked a loaf bread--the first for me, and good at that. I was up all night playing cards. Others were betting; I don’t bet. I mended my pants and went to bed at day light.</span>

<strong>Wednesday 2</strong> - Slept till noon. I got up  and cooked my breakfast, or dinner, as you please. I cut some wood and packed it in for both stoves. I prepared for supper.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I paid a for box of tea $1, supped, and took a sashay round town and back home. I took a bath and mended a pair of socks John left and washed the pair I wore from Marysville. The sun shone warm this afternoon. I now turn in.</span>

<strong>Thursday 3</strong> - Quite frosty this morning. I did some cutting on the top of a tree that blew over in the field out in the barn lot. Then I and Truit cut down the body and are now sawing it for wood. I got 1 pound butter of Mrs. Duesler at $.75. I and Hogan have been playing cribbage. He made 10 and I 8 games. Warm sun.

<strong>Friday 4</strong> - Clear and pleasant today. We finished sawing up the tree and split some more. I am still able to do what cooking I need, but don’t try the milking.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">After quitting work I went down to the store and got a letter from my wife and John dated January 29th 1859. They both are of the opinion they had better wait a few months longer before going to Kentucky. It is all right.</span>

<strong>Saturday 5</strong> - Cloudy all day, a little rain.

<strong>Sunday 6</strong> - Cloudy with some rain. I was waked up before day by  the smell of a skunk. My first thought was that the speckled pullet under the house had paid the penalty, as there was nothing else the stinking varmint could handle. But morning came and so did the hen, for her grub. The speckled cow calved last night in the barn. You ought to have seen me give it the teat--but never too old learn.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Breakfast over, I cleaned up the dishes and then went to make some bread, which I did in good style. I then cleaned up my room and looked around and found the hen house roof was about to cave in.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">It was somewhat rainy all day. I closed the day by taking dinner and supper all at one time. What a pleasant time one has  by himself, with none to dispute.</span></span>

<strong>Monday 7</strong> - Rained last night and today some. I was righting the chicken house. I paid $1 for beef and $1 for candles and hauled two cords of wood to John Bass, and delivered them to Mrs. Inman. Price $3 per cord, I suppose---

<strong>Tuesday 8</strong> - Still raining. After doing up  the chores and cooking I cleaned out the hen house and took down the old nests to put them up anew.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Overton was to see me had some chat about money matters. I told him he should be paid for waiting. I wrote a letter to my wife and John.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">It was raining very hard at bed time.</span>

<strong>Wednesday 9</strong> - It has snowed considerably last night, and continued. By noon I finished putting up two dozen hens’ nests. It was still snowing some. After getting my dinner I put my time in downtown.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I had forgotten, I had Byers to move his six oxen to be fed elsewhere on Monday evening last. After supper, and after the milk pans and dishes were cleaned up I looked over the Argus and made the entries for the last three days.</span>

<strong>Thursday 10</strong> - It continues to snow a little day and night without increasing the depth but a little in the valley. I baked another loaf of bread, and am saving a churning of cream. I sold William Ford a lot of ground 75 feet wide and 70 feet long for $80 cash. It was paid to Overton. I also gave $20 more. I put a lock on the kitchen door and made a top to the churn and scalded it, ready for use.

<strong>Friday 11</strong> - It snowed some two in deep last night and continued letting it down today, but not enough to keep it from melting away. I warmed some skimmed milk and I  and Jones has a time to get the calves to drink. I put my cream near the cook stove to sour. I next finished the hen house and put some old lime in the holes to level up. I did some work on the barn door and other places. I fixed the big gate in front and warmed some milk for the calves.

<strong>Saturday 12</strong> - The snow fell about 1 foot deep last night, and yet in some places it nearly all went off, with a little sun and a little snow occasionally. I put a handle to the skimmer and one to an old fry pan and put some damns across the branch of the creek in the yard. It takes much of my time to feed, cook and milk, and some one has scalded Gris on the left flank. He stays at home now all the time. I let Bates have the oxen and sledge, $4.

<strong>Sunday 13</strong> - After doing up the cattle churns I got breakfast. That over, I made up some dough and put it to baking. I then fixed for churning, which I did in good style. When in to came dressing the butter I was most desperately awkward, but I got through and had some 4 or 5 pounds. The first thing of the kind I ever did. My bread baked by noon. I took some butter, milk and bread for dinner. I put on my new calico shirt on and went up town to see the fashions. The e. clampus is all the go. It snowed last night and today as usual.

<strong>Monday 14</strong> - The snow fell two inches deep here last night and some little today at intervals. About noon the sun shone out very warm. I cleaned the cow dung out the barn.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Earlier, Bates paid $4 for the use of the team, and Stinson $.50 for grinding two axes.</span>

P.M. I sorted some potatoes and put all the potatoes on a plank one foot from ground to keep the gofers out of them.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">There is a Valentine’s dance going on in the old courthouse. Six females. </span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I paid $1.75 for beef.</span>

<strong>Tuesday 15</strong> - It continues to storm. Not much snow fell in the valley last night, but enough to hide the old tracks. It was snowing all day, but melts as fast as it falls. Late this evening it set in very fast. I sorted and sacked up 5 sacks in all, 16 more to go over.

<strong>Wednesday 16</strong> - Well, the storm continues. The snow fell a foot deep last night, though it is quite soft. Cloudy all day. Late in the day it commenced snowing and is still at it half past 9:00 as I write this P.M.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I did nothing outside my regular cooking feeding, and I paid for 2 1/2 dozen screws 2 inches long, $.50. I built a fire to go to bed by in my room. A pleasant life this, but none to speak with.</span>

<strong>Thursday 17</strong> - This indeed is a gloomy morning. From all appearances it has been snowing all night last. It is deeper in the valley than it has been this winter and falling fast. The wind blew very hard from the East at one time. I kept the two cows all day in the barn and fed them well.

P.M. I made and baked a loaf of bread and churned again, and made a good article. I bought six milk pans, cost $4.50. It snowed hard all day and up to 10:00 P.M.

<strong>Friday 18</strong> - After snowing more or less last night the sun shone out warm most of the day. It was quite cold this morning. I sorted two sacks of potatoes. Quite cold this evening. I paid $.75 for beef.

<strong>Saturday 19</strong> - Cold last night. About 3:00 A.M. the old Bradley barn caved in on some of Duesler’s cows, crippling them some, on account of the snow.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I sorted some potatoes. I had Smail make and paint a milk cupboard, or press. I’ve not got it home as yet.</span>

<strong>Sunday 20</strong> - Cold and frosty last night but warm and sunny all day. Quite a number of sleighs in town today. Dickson dined with me. The mail was brought in yesterday evening and no letters for me.

<strong>Monday 21</strong> - Very cold last night. The sun shone but little, It soon clouded up and snowed a little most of the day. I brought home my milk cupboard. I took the top off the kitchen table and cleaned it; I will try and screw it down level. I baked another loaf of bread. I paid $2 for beef. I keep Gris chained, and have, for some days and nights. I mended my boot and blacked the pair. I broke open one of the natives’ meat houses, the first of the kind.

<strong>Tuesday 22</strong> - It snowed two inches deep last night, but cleared up today. I fixed up the tables in the kitchen and was all day churning. I did not take the butter out of the churn at night. I sorted some potatoes. The Plumas Rangers was out today and fired several platoons in honor of the birthday of the father of this country.[note]President's Day.[/note] The E Clampus[note]E Clampus Vitus, a fraternal organization founded in 1849.[/note] was in full blast tonight.

<strong>Wednesday 23</strong> - Cold last night. Ice froze in the kitchen. It was snowing this morning and continued all day and until a late hour tonight.
I dressed my third churning of butter. Bates has the team a short time in the A.M. I cleaned out the calf pen and got my regular three meals.

<strong>Thursday 24</strong> - Snowing still but the sun shone out at intervals. It cleared off near night. The preacher came down. I gave him some sweat and buttermilk. He also got two bales hay, and is to pay $3.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">The speckled cow turned over Jones’ bucket of milk. Dick the French  man gave me $1 for the use of team to haul a load of wood. I hauled two cords to Mrs. Inman for John Bass at $3 per cord. I lost my pocket knife last night or this morning, through a hole in my pocket. I tore the remainder out of my pantaloons.</span>

<strong>Friday 25</strong> - Cloudy and somewhat stormy. We tie the white faced cow head and heel with the right foot fastened in the floor when we milk. I baked another loaf of bread and churned for the fourth time. It was hard to churn. I put a new pocket in my pants tonight and washed off all over. I paid $.75 for beef and sold to Kirlin $.25 work of buttermilk.

<strong>Saturday 26</strong> - It snowed last night but not in the valley. Peal and Jones had the team to haul wood, a load for each, and one for me. They cut it I sorted some potatoes. Cloudy all day, but cleared off at night. John Bass found my knife and gave it to me.

<strong>Sunday 27</strong> - Rain and snow falling very fast this morning and then turned to snow all day. The sun shone out a little before setting. After a little, it was snowing again up until a late bedtime.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I fixed a knob on the cupboard door I sewed up a rip in my boot, blacked, and greased two pairs, and put on a clean shirt, after sewing up the rips.</span>

<strong>Monday 28</strong> - It snowed last night and some this morning, but the sun came out warm. I paid $.75 for beef. I let Bates have the team and got Taylor’s right fore foot snagged. Jones and I sawed off 5 blocks for wood off the down tree in garden. I fixed the saw and made a bench to file on.
