Dear Uncle and Cousin

I sit down to night after
aunty &amp; Dr Hamill have gone to church

a little sick all day a thought I would
not go to church, but write to Dear Old
Uncle I wrote you a letter a few weeks ago
and have writen John one, Aunt Lizie

we had some shooting done last week
between Lawyer Robinson’s son Jimmie
and H Hynes I suppose John knew
Mr Hynes he was a military student
he was dismissed a few months ago
or rather expelled the difficulty arose abrod
Ellen Finell Robbinson shot

[torn] but did not kill him
[torn] longer &amp; they have not
[torn] with Robinson yet it is supposed
[torn]and Hunes engaged to be married but
I do not know whether it is true or not
Hynes was taken up to Mrs Finells
the next morning after she was shot. Mr Clark
is married he married Miss Eve Stenson
of Parris Ky. It is just one year
to day since you left- it seems to me
a very long year Oh Uncle you cannot

ent any news of importance to write so I
must come to a close church will soon
be out give my love to John Aunt says

good deal of good to get a letter from you
