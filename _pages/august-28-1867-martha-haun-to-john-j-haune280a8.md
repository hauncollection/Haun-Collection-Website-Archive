My Dear Son,

Your pa received your letter on the 16th[note]Not included in this collection.[/note] of this month and we were somewhat disappointed. It was so long before we got a letter that we come to the conclusion that you were on your way home—but I think it is best the way it is, for it is a sickly season of the year to travel. Yet we are so anxious to see you. I took a good cry when we got your letter, for it seemed to me that I was never to see you again. I have had so many disappointments about seeing you, that I almost despair at times, yet it is the little hope that is left in me that keeps me up. Oh my son, come to us and let me have that pleasure before I die—to see you once more.

Your pa is very busy now hauling in his hay and wheat. The crop is fine this year again. He has two men to cut and haul; he has at last got the ranch so that he does not have to hire like he used to. That is why he has not written. I was sick last week I am now well.

There are three different people wanting the ranch. They have made no offer as your pa told them he was expecting you out and did not care to sell until you came. If we could have sold during the war we would gladly have done so, but now there is talk of the rail road going through this valley. They will complete a wagon road to Rabbit Creek this summer and they are making a wagon road along the canon to Indian Vally. These roads will make ranches valuable in this valley. Crops are now surer here than below. Fred King of Mohawk sold his property for eighteen thousand dollars and wants to buy this. Dick Trunin also wants it, and Creed Harmond. I tell your pa if we can get 10 thousand dollars to take it. I believe we will get that before two years.

I received a letter from Mary. I will answer it soon. Son if you marry, you and her, take that box of clothing and pack up all the valuables and bring them with you. There are a lot of new linen sheeting and towels and pillow cases and all of my quilts. I want you to give anything that you do not bring to Betty. You can pack them in a trunk or small box, and do come. If you only have money enough to bring you to San Francisco, we can manage it then. If we were all together we could tell them better what to do and all would be satisfied. Tell us in your next when you will start so I will know when to look for you. Oh son, let me beg of you to come and see what we have got for you here.

Your pa is so anxious to give up the business to you and let you do as you are a minded to with it. He says he will always do everything to help you that he can, but he is getting so that it is too much for us at our age. It will take so little to do us the balance of our days, and we are so anxious to see you get what we have. If you was only here with a wife that would take an interest in your affairs we could all live so easy and comfort able and enjoy life.

Then let a fond and devoted mother entreat you to come to here. We love you better than anything on this earth and have done the best we could for your interest. Oh come to smooth our dying pillows, for in the course of nature we cannot be here a great while longer. Give my love to all of the kin and to Betty and Sam and the child. Go and see your aunts before you leave. I would like so much to have their pictures. Ask them to your wedding if you marry. How glad I would be if Sam and Betty could come with you. Your pa sends his best love to you and says come, and if you want to go back you can sell out and do so.

I hope this will be the last letter I will have to write you there,

M. Haun
