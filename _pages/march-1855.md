<strong>Thursday 1</strong> - Still raining, and continued more or less till noon. The sun shone out in the afternoon. We got gold $24.

<strong>Friday 2 </strong>- Cool last night, and quite foggy. The forenoon the evening was pleasant, with sunshine. We cleaned up bedrock and got gold $43. Lawrance and Shults cut a gulch to run the tailings by their diggins, that they may clean up the bedrock.

<strong>Saturday 3</strong> - Rained in the night last and this morning. Cleared up at noon. The sun shone pleasantly this evening. We cut two small and two large trees and we went to wash the ground away where they stood. The large one broke and bounced on two boxes and spoilt them entirely. We fixed up again in the afternoon and then piped down the stumps and bark. We cleaned up and got gold $68 —

<strong>Sunday 4</strong> - A beautiful sunny morning. We went up to the reservoir and let the water run out, running off the dirt that had stopped in it, caused by the rain.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I then went down to the Point. No mail. The vigilance committee called a meeting. They stated their object and asked to be sustained in what they have done by the miners — rather a failure. My lesson is the first chapter of Revelations.</span>

<strong>Monday 5 </strong>- Rained last night and most of the day, but lightly. I and Shaw were at work as usual and got gold $17. John commenced at a new place by himself.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I refused to let Lloyd work in our company any more, because I had told him that I positively would not work with a drinking man if I could help it.</span>

<strong>Tuesday 6</strong> - Rained last night and all of today. Shaw told me early that Lloyd wanted to have a settlement. I was making a stool when he and Shaw came over. He said he wanted a divide of the money we have taken out while he was on a spree. I told him I would not be bothered with him long. He abused and threatened, so we struck at each other. Shaw caught me, and Lloyd picked up the drawing knife that was on the table at his side and made several attempts to strike me with it. I got hold of the hatchet near the door. He then laid down the drawing knife. I then went up to him said if he would go out and give me a fair fight I would treat him as a gentleman. He then went off.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Shaw, Lawrance and the wretch divided the provisions and part of the tools. I, Shaw and John went down to the Point. I got Duesler to write a bill of sale for my entire interest in all my property to John for $1,000 cash-in-hand, paid, and went home again. The wretch is claiming an interest in everything he wants.</span>

<strong>Wednesday 7 </strong>- Rained quite hard last night and most of the day. Lloyd was moving his provisions this morning. He is still not willing to take what is his own but wants more. I went down to the Point. Nelson Creek and Feather River was both higher than I’ve seen them before. I came home in the evening. The mail came in, but no letters. I bought three newspapers, $1. Shaw and John got gold $8.50.

<strong>Thursday 8</strong> - I, John and Shaw was mining as usual. Several men came up from the Point a-prospecting. Lloyd was down to the Point to advertise for a miners meeting. It rained some this evening. We got gold $70.

<strong>Friday 9 </strong>- Early this morning Lloyd came to Shaw’s cabin and left a written notice forbidding me from using any tools that he had an interest in until divided, like the dog on the hay.[note]Variation on the popular saying 'dog in the manger' used to describe an individual who prevents others from having access to what he or she has no use for.[/note] He won’t divide and wants us to keep from work. Rain and sunshine alternately today. We gold gold $87.

<strong>Saturday 10 </strong>- Frosty this morning, and foggy. The air is rather cool. We were at work as usual. We got gold $115. Lawrance and Shults are making wages. Lloyd said to Lawrance  that I had Shaw bribed. It made Shaw very mad.

<strong>Sunday 11</strong> - Last night I dreamed of being with my wife, but do not recollect at what place. Though pleasantly situated, I awoke out of those pleasantries, put on my slippers, and walked out of the cabin. Clear and cold, with the ground covered in snow that had fallen in the night. Daylight was near at hand. I called up the  boys, breakfasted, greased my boots, and then down to the Point with this object in view: to stop the miners from coming up to our diggins and holding an arbitration for the benefit of Lloyd. I accomplished my goal in good style, there being but four men who came, and two of them I sent. I used all the means in my power to accomplish it. Nothing done for him as yet. Before going to bed I read the five last chapters of Revelations.

<strong>Monday 12</strong> - I set up till midnight and was up at daybreak. The ground was covered with snow again, and it was still falling. It continued all day raining and snowing. After dinner I and Shults went down to the Point with two picks to sharpen, cost $1.50, and 20 pounds beef, $5. We got gold $27. Lloyd told Shaw that he was going to the American Valley to try me at law.

<strong>Tuesday 13</strong> - Rained and snowed all of last night and today, but not so much in the afternoon. Shults and Lawrance went to work in the P.M.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I and John went down to the Point. We met the constable and he read his documents to me: a suit for $200 and damages for $300 to be tried on Thursday the 15th. Lloyd is the plaintiff in the lawsuit.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">John bought a pair of boots, $4.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">John had a fuss with G. Kline, he being drunk. Several persons kept them from fighting. Then a fellow by the name of Jim Preston pulled off his coat to give John a fight, but when he was ready I was in front of him. He soon left.</span>

<strong>Wednesday 14</strong> - The ground was covered with snow this morning. We finished sewing another seem in our piece of new hose. I, Shaw and John went out to the diggins, cleared away some brush, and set up our penstock again. To get a greater head of water, we concluded to try the old hose again. We brought the new one back on to the cabin at noon. Afterwards, we cut a new leading ditch to run water in the penstock higher up. We then cleared off some small trees. One fell the wrong way and broke three old sluice boxes.

<strong>Thursday 15</strong> - I, Shaw and John was clearing off timber this forenoon. The ground was covered with snow and quite cold and frosty. The sun was shining warm and pleasant quite all day. In the after noon all five, including Shults, went down to the Point to try another lawsuit, this time with Lloyd. Before the Jury was had some of them expressed a wish the case would be put off until tomorrow. The court concurred in that wish, as there was no objection made.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I finished my letter to H.P. and mailed it, 25 cents. There is a ball to be held at the Point tonight. That is the reason the case was put off.</span>

<strong>Friday 16</strong> - Cold and clear last night. This morning we all went down to the Point, but a short time before court was called. A jury was had of twelve men, but some half dozen was objected to and others not so good filled their places. Shaw was examined at great length by the plaintiff’s attorney. We adjourned for dinner, $1 each. A witness stated that Lloyd offered me $200 to let him continue as he had been working, but the jury brought in a verdict against me for $300 and ordered me to restore him again in the company. So, I paid one of my lawyers $25, and John brought a judgement against Freer and Vaughn of G. Kline for $107.50 and some other costs. The judgement is $171 with costs and interest.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Lloyd was heard to say that Hawkins told him I stole gold out of the pan. I then swore out a peace warrant against Lloyd for trying to cut me with a drawing knife.
Such is my troubles today, and but few to say I am right.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">These are the names of the jury: Asa Bryan, John Bass, Steve Bass, Beach, I. Cook, Smith, Collier, George Poor, Kinman, George Runnells, J.H. Smith, Larisson, Titus. Has God forsaken me? Will the Lord forgive me the wrongs I’ve done and keep me safe from mine enemy?</span>

<strong>Saturday 17</strong> - Cool last night and this morning. No work today. We was waiting patiently for the office. Finally, I sent Shaw and Lawrance down to see what was going on. The constable met them and served a notice on Shaw, then came on and took John with him. He asked me if I was not going down. I said not. Lawrance came up for me and said the squire was waiting for me. I then went down.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Lloyd was in custody. I swore out a peace warrant against him. I, Shaw and John all testified that he tried to strike me with a drawing knife, and that he had killed a man in Kentucky in 1843, besides the threats and insults he had made. The court bound him over to keep the peace for 6 months and give security for $250. He is certainly the most wicked and vindictive piece of humanity I ever saw, to say nothing of his ungratefulness to me.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We divided $512 into four shares, one to Shaw and 3 to John, including $50.50, the half that Lawrance made in the last month. Larn paid me $4 borrowed money. I am not considered quite so bad a man today as was spoken of yesterday.</span>

<strong>Sunday 18</strong> - Warm last night and cloudy this morning. We all went down to the Point this forenoon. Duesler was authorized to give Lloyd a notice that the mountain company had no more water running in their ditch than they themselves had use for. I gave Duesler $35 in fees and paid $4 for beef company
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Big John Davis has got back to the Point. I stated publicly that he swore to a falsehood in November last for Vaughn. It has been said that he would attack me. He spoke to me and we shook hands.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I read this morning the 13th chapter of Matthew. Shaw paid C. Allen’s Board bill of $2.50 to our share &amp;c —</span>

<strong>Monday 19</strong> - The last night was not cold, though a little frosty. Today has been quite warm and pleasant. The winged insects were trying thee old tricks again a-buzzing and billing. We all five were to work again. I, Shaw and John got gold $13. Lawance and Shults about the same, but they have not weighed it. Lloyd is trying to get a man to work with us but has not succeeded as yet. We all went down to the Point to hear the case argued for a new trial, but the judge has gone to a ball, up the creek to Madden’s.

<strong>Tuesday 20</strong> - The night was somewhat frosty and today was one of those pleasant sunny days. The ground squirrels were out today, the first I’ve seen. We went to work betimes and Lloyd has sent a man by the name of Williams to work in his place, but I told him the company had use for all the water that was running in the company ditch, so he left soon. We got gold $40.50.

<strong>Wednesday 21 </strong>- Pleasant weather indeed. we were cleaning up bedrock.

P.M. I spliced the hose. We gold gold $67. Quit early. After supper we all went down to the Point to try for a new trial, but the squire would not grant it. So my counsel gave notice we would take an appeal.

<strong>Thursday 22</strong> - A beautiful and pleasant morning. After a few hours of broken sleep I was up before day and called up all hands in both cabins. We ate breakfast and I prepared to leave for Marysville. I, Shaw and John went down to the Point. I gave Lewis, H. Bray and Shaw $1000 as security in my case with Lloyd. John was to weigh that sum to Shaw in dust to make the security good and safe. I then got the squire to make out the costs which was $49.50. I paid the justice and took a receipt for the same. I just then got a letter from H.P. stating that I had gained the case with Vaughn in the supreme court.[note]Currently researching this case.[/note] The letter cost 5 cents. I bid John and Shaw goodbye and they started home. I ate dinner with Lewis, cost $1. With a heavy heart I gazed at the high, snow capped mountain that lay before me, and then moved steadily off to climb over its height. Before I had near reached its summit I discovered that I had lost my old butcher knife out of the scabbard while a-scuffling through the brush and snow. As I had no further use for the scabbard, I took it off and laid it in between two trees. I made Gibsonville in good time, though I mired down often in the snow. I stopped at the mountain cottage 12 miles from home.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">After dark I passed a large house. It seemed free to enter. In I went and saw four Mexican woman and a lot of dirty miners dancing. After the set was out, men and woman went up to the bar and took something to drink. Next followed a stag dance. When that was out I left and went to bed. I rested but indifferently.</span>

<strong>Friday 23 </strong>- A fine morning. I could not get a mule hire. I and two other men started for Rabbit Creek. My supper, lodging and breakfast $2.50. We arrived at Rabbit Creek at 10 A.M., ten miles over the snow and slush. There I saw Vaughn. I got a mule to ride to the Buckeye House, 12 miles, past the Lexington, New York Star, the American, and Diamond Spring houses to the Buckeye. I ate dinner before 2:00 P.M., cost $1. I stop here till morning I went to bed at a late hour, &amp;c.

<strong>Saturday 24 </strong>- Up before day. The keepers of the Buckeye are two partners, the land lady is a grass widow,[note]"Grass widow" is slang for an unmarried or divorced woman.[/note] the other is a young man. Supper, lodging and breakfast, $2.50. Mule and stage fare, $5 to Marysville. I saw a buck negro wash his face and hands and wipe with the same towel and blow his nose on it, all so that white men who used it after he had done this...
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We started stated early on mule’s back for the Oregon House, 28 miles. Took dinner $1, and then went on to Marysville. I arrived by stage by 4:00 P.M. I then walked out to H.P.’s by sunset.</span>

<strong>Sunday 25 </strong>- I and Jack went up to Park’s Bar on the Yuba River. We were not back until after dark —

<strong>Monday 26</strong> - I went out to the upper ranch with Jack and four others to help him finish sewing barley. Got back at dark.

<strong>Tuesday 27</strong> - Went to town with Jack after dinner and back again.

<strong>Wednesday 28 </strong>- I went up Ouslys Bar with H.P. He had a lawsuit, and gained it. We then came home again, arriving at sunset.

<strong>Thursday 29</strong> - I went to town with H.P. He concluded to go up with me into the mountains. We then went out to the ranch.

<strong>Friday 30</strong> - It commenced raining early this morning quite hard, so we concluded to wait until tomorrow.

P.M. We went to town. I bought a waterproof hat and a pair of boots and gum leggings for $7.50. I received two letters from my wife mailed in Iowa, dated February 12 1855[note]This letter has been preserved and is available <a title="February 12 1855" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/version-iii-series-ii/february-12-1855-martha-haun-to-james-haun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.[/note] and February 19 1855[note]This letter has been preserved and is available <a title="February 19 1855" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/version-iii-series-ii/february-19-1855-martha-haun-to-james-haun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.[/note] stating that she would start home to Kentucky on the next day. Also, that she would start to California by the first of May at farthest. I then wrote my 18th letter in answer and mailed it. We went out to the ranch again to stay all night. Raining quite hard.

<strong>Saturday 31</strong> - Raining hard this morning. H.P. would not start so we gave it up for the day, though the sun shone out at intervals in the afternoon.
