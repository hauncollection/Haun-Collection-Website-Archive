<strong>Thursday 1</strong> - The rats have annoyed me lately of nights. I fixed a deadfall,[note]A type of mouse trap.[/note] so I caught two last night. I did some sewing on the hose.

P.M. All was at work doing well, but it could not hold out so, for the hose burst—our new one at that. I was the rest of the day mending it, John and Roister was cleaning up bedrock and got gold $44.

<strong>Thursday 2</strong> - We took out two pieces of old hose. It took me some time to fix them up and slip them over the main ones. That done I went to piping again in the left set of boxes. We got but little out of them.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">John was cleaning up bedrock in the middle set and got gold $25. Streater, the tax assessor, came to our diggins late in the day and assisted me.</span>

<strong>Friday 3</strong> - We are taking the world easily. Remained in bed until after sunrise (what a bed!) and then cooked our own breakfast. This is what one would call a retired way of living. I’m not fond of company.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Shaw and Lawrance came to our diggins early. They wanted we should pay them off before the time. We concluded to do so, if they would knock off a liberal discount. We are to let them know on Sunday. That is a busy day is this country. We got gold $14.</span>

<strong>Saturday 4</strong> - I dreamed last night that I was in company with my wife and sister Mary, on horse back. I was riding old Trump. My wife said he was nearly starved to death. I know not where we were going. I thought John was riding his pony in some town. I felt that my wife did not treat me as she ought to have done. She seemed distant.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Well, we worked steady and hard all day and only got $26. We have so much moving of boxes and hose and pipe. We had a pleasant haze at noontime, but no appearance of rain.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I so often think of my wife. Will she come out this fall with Dave?</span>

<strong>Sunday 5</strong> - Well this is another sabbath. I’ve read the first and second chapters of Colossians, it being my place of reading. We next got down our sand bottle and emptied it into a pan. I poured in quick silver and paned out the sand and got out of the quick silver, $17. We rocked out of the square box and got $5.50, but stopped for the want of a better rocker.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Shaw came up to see if we was ready to let him off, so we all went down to the Point. I gave Roister his share of last week’s work, it being $41.75. I then collected $200 in gold dust from John Bass for the purpose of paying off Shaw, but he said he would not leave until Wednesday morning. Besides, he did not want to pay me $25 discount before it was due.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">John was in the express and got two letters from his ma, the first one written to him on June 19th[note]Not included in this collection.[/note], and three sheets full with a piece of poetry to me dated June 23 1855[note]This letter has been preserved and is available <a title="June 23 1855" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/version-iii-series-ii/june-23-1855-martha-haun-to-james-haun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.[/note] giving an account of Moore’s[note]James' brother-in-law, the husband of Martha's sister Elizabeth.[/note] treatment to her and Lizzie, and other things too tedious to mention, also some lines of poetry—very appropriate indeed. She gave an account of the death Alex Keene and Mrs T. White and Mrs Grant and the breaking of some of my acquaintances, and her not being not so low spirited as she was when she  wrote John’s letter, but winds up by saying that she does not want to come to California.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I gave $1 for a brush to brush down the gold in the boxes and 50 cents for the two letters.</span>

<strong>Monday 6</strong> - We been a little lazy of late in getting up. The sun is generally up before we get up. Breakfast is soon got and then to work. We cut down two small trees moved the logs out of the way. We washed down one of the stumps.

P.M. I did some mending on the hose. John cleaned some bedrock got gold $9.

<strong>Tuesday 7</strong> - We was at work as usual. We built a log heap and then fixed for mining. John went to let the water on the pipe and saw it was muddy. He then went up to the reservoir and found two men at work near it. He told them not to muddy the water.

P.M. I went up there and told them that they was at work on my ground and it was no use for hem to prospect it. I had a notice on it two days previous. They quit work for the present. I told them that Shaw knew we hit the ground for more than a year. Shaw told them so. I paid Shaw $530 for the note he held against us instead of $550 due on the first of September, and borrowed $104 of John Thompson. Besides I loaned Roister $60 to pay off Lawrance, the Yankee knave.

<strong>Wednesday 8</strong> - We went on Tuesday to the diggins for the purpose of working, but did very little in the A.M. John went to see Lawrance at the Willow Ranch to get 3/8 of $8 that Lawrance had washed out of a sand bottle, but he would not let him have it. So I went down and made him shell it out. A mean yankee —
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Well, next this company said they were going to work that ground or die, so I told them I would keep them from it if I could. They accordingly went to work again. They are using our water and making it very muddy.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We cleaned out the ditch below them that leads the seep water into our hose and pipe. I took off a piece of hose as it was too long, and had to sew on a short piece. We got all ready again for tomorrow. John paid the Bucks $1 for whiskey.</span>

<strong>Thursday 9</strong> - We was at work in fair time and let the water on our hose and pipe, but is was not long before the muddy water was down on us from the mines between our reservoir and our seep ditch. we was compelled to quit work.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We all three went up to where they were at work. I told them that we was compelled to quit work that they muddied our water so the screen would choke up and the water run over. They swore they would work it or die. Old Lloyd was there. We started away, and he commenced to talk. I went back and told the good for nothing old murderer not to open his mouth. I told him to ask Jennings Clark what he was good for. He had been stealing money out of draw. I then told him if ever I heard a word that he said about me I would punish him for it and that I meant to make him eat his words, what he had said about me. I dared to repeat it. He was afraid to say one word even.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">So, I wrote a letter to H.P. stating to him my troubles and for Jack to come up. Also, my 21st letter to my wife. All three of us went down to the Point. I mailed the letters and paid $.25, and John got a letter cost $.25 from H.P. stating that there were all well and that he was a candidate for the senate and would be elected. We got gold $27 —</span>

<strong>Friday 10</strong> - Up this morning before sunrise and called the rest up. We went to work, but it was not long before the muddy water came down on us.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">My friends Duesler and Shaw came  up early. I threw off my rubber clothes and we three went up to the place where they were using our water. I told them again, you have stopped us from work and our hose was choked with mud this morning. They had a riffle, revolver and dirk knife each. I told them they seemed to be well armed, as to my part, I had nothing, but I said to them that I would try them for stealing—a penal offense. I got Duesler to look at the position of the water and ditches and reservoir, and so they did not muddy our water this after noon. I suppose they did not work. We got gold $17.50 —</span>

<strong>Saturday 11 </strong>- We fixed for cleaning up bedrock and did so. Got gold $32. The men did not muddy our water but for a short time this A.M.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">After supper all three of us went down to the Point, to get two picks and hatchet sharpened. I paid Thompson $80 of the $104 that I had borrowed, and joined the W.K., at the cost of $4. We then came home.</span>

<strong>Sunday 12</strong> - It was quite late when we breakfasted. I read the First Epistle of Paul to Timothy. I made a pick handle. I and John started up the ditch with tools and rifle. We laid out, and dug a ditch from the largest ravine to the entry of our ditch. That done, we went home and had some dinner rather late.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We next went up the Pike ditch and worked on it  until night. Then John half soled his gum boots. I cut and split some wood. I took out the ashes and got new and irons. I built a fire and lit a candle and read the Second Epistle of Paul to Timothy while they were baking bread and getting supper.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I shed many tears of grief, while thinking of our lonely condition and that of my poor wife, separated as we were. I tried to sing some old fashioned hymns but I am in a strange land, my harp is hung upon the cedars. O, weep not for me my own dearest wife. In noting this down I’ve shed tears that burned my cheeks as they pass down among the unshaven beard. For nearly two years we have been apart.</span>

<strong>Monday 13</strong> - I and John was taking our rest  after sunrise when all of a sudden Roister wrapped several times quite hard. We soon got ready for work and fixed for cleaning up bedrock — but it was not long before our water was made muddy by those intruders. It remained muddy till noon, and soon after we got done cleaning up. It was late before we got ready for piping but we made a start. We got gold $16.

<strong>Sunday 14</strong> - Well, we done a great amount of work with hose and pipe to have only got $2, besides our water was made quite muddy most of the day. I was up sooner this morning than previous ones. Our notice was renewed up on the reservoir flat —

<strong>Wednesday 15</strong> - Well, we worked over considerable ground and did not make two bits. We run the bedrock out of the ground and came to where the channel split. We quit the one on our left and followed the one on our right. We had to set out boxes anew and made a commencement.

<strong>Thursday 16</strong> - We are at work alongside where John and old Lloyd worked this time last year, but I fear there there is not so much gold to be had as was then. At least our day’s work is quite slim, only $9 —
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I dreamed of my wife the last two nights in connection with some other young woman: the first night she was with Lizzy and last night Miss Tess Connor.</span>

<strong>Friday 17</strong> - We have run our diggins to the top of the ground, what I would call entirely out of gold. We scrapped and cleaned about, and only got $1 by noon. So we concluded to move our tools. We set to work in the P.M. cleaning the brush off the ground claimed by Roister, down below where we first commenced on these claims. I mended a piece of hose to lengthen those we are at work with, in order to get a  head on the pipe.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I dreamed of G. Toppass. I thought he was broke and that his sisters broke him. I still think of two woman and I hope they will make their appearance soon.</span>

<strong>Saturday 18</strong> - We worked till noon cutting and burning brush and small logs on Roister’s claim. In the P.M. we mended up the heap and cut a small ditch to run the water onto the diggins.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">It was cloudy all day and sprinkled a very little this P.M. We quit work much before sunset and all took a good wash, as we were quite black and dirty. After supper we went down to the Point. It was quite late when returned to our cabins.</span>

<strong>Sunday 19</strong> - Rained some this morning before daylight to cover the dust a little. We were rather late getting breakfast. I and Roister went down to the Point.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I took dinner with F.S. Fox, the present proprietor of the Thompson House, formally the cook for Thompson. After dinner I was invited in to see Mrs Fox, the mother of F.S. Fox. I talked with the old lady for more than one hour. I wore a read flannel shirt outside my pants and an old dirty cotton shirt. No cravat or socks. On first acquaintance I was treated quite cleaver indeed. I excused my self for having occupied so much of her time. Dinner $1.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I read the general Epistle of James. Cloudy. Thundered and rained a little in the P.M.</span>

<strong>Monday 20</strong> - We was till noon setting our boxes and penstock and leading troughs. After dinner we commenced to pipe down and wash dirt for gold again. We got $9, much more than we expected for a start. We have come to the conclusion to move lower down, as we think it will pay. We expect to do so tomorrow.

<strong>Tuesday 21</strong> - I paid Duesler $2 for our share of the planks last Saturday night.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We accordingly moved penstock, hose, boxes, and the rest our tools downhill to where there has been a little mining. We got ready for work a short time after dinner, but it was not long until our hose burst the sewing. I was sometime in mending it. We turned on the water again and did considerable washing. We cleaned up and got gold $1 rather low down.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I dreamed of my wife last night. I thought I was in Georgetown, Kentucky.</span>

<strong>Wednesday 22</strong> - We concluded to run a narrow cut up, until it pays better. We let the water on, but there was not enough to do any good. John went up to the reservoir and let out some.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">After dinner I applied calk to the boxes that brought in the water, known as Pike’s ditch. John and Roister got gold $5.</span>

<strong>Thursday 23</strong> - Again we are found at our post, ready to dig out the shining stuff, but our water is failing some, and at a time when there is none to spare. John went up to the reservoir and let out some water. At noon we stopped the water. After noon we let it out again. We have to be very careful of the water, or else we cannot get enough to work with.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Late in the morning the hose ripped. It took me the rest of the day to mend it up again. We got gold $10.</span>

<strong>Friday 24</strong> - I woke out of sleep this morning sometime before day. I was too warm, so I threw off the blankets and thought of my wife. Where shall I look for her? I’ve tried to fix a day, but cannot make it out. I fell to sleep again. I dreamed of her being with me, and it was not at all unpleasant. I was up at day light. Breakfast was soon over and then to work. There is more or less time taken up in fixing for work. The dirt is hard to wash. Late in the evening our hose ripped again, and the rest of my time was put in mending it. We got gold $16.50.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">After supper I set in the doorway and looked at the moon and towards my native home. I felt low spirited, but again when I leave the cabins for work I’ve caught myself looking back to see if wife is not coming up the hill.</span>

<strong>Saturday 25</strong> - The clouds that had the appearance of rain the last 24 hours have passed off. We three—it is hardly worth while to call us, the once big mountain company—but we are at our posts from day today. We got gold $21.50.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">After supper we all went down to the Point. I paid Thompson $29 for beef and grub. I paid him for a new grey shirt $1.50, and paid Mrs Duesler $1.50 for washing four hickory shirts, plus 25 cents for a letter from my wife dated the 2nd July 1855.[note]Possibly one of the undated letters.[/note] Her letter gives an account of her then happy condition, compared to what it had been. I must confess that I am truly glad to hear it, but it is far from my fix. I think if I only could lay eyes on her I should then feel like myself again. I still hope the time will soon come, &amp;c. We took down a dozen empty bottles and got one filled with whiskey in exchange, not to drink, but to put in our vinegar keg. I read the letter to John after returning home and he is now playing on the old fiddle while I am noting this down.</span>

<strong>Saturday 25 </strong>- A man by name Frank Walker went up to the bridge that crosses Feather River above Nelson Creek and stopped off to take a wash. He made a dive and struck his head against a rock. Those present became alarmed on account of his long absence under water, and then, seeing the blood in the water, next saw him struggling. They sprang in and hauled him out. That was on Friday evening the 24th, and this evening he is dead. Root was seen gambling witness Roister.
<strong>
Sunday 26</strong> - We were late getting up, as it was late before we went to our bunks. When breakfasted, we started up the ditch and then up to the spring in the mountains. The coldest water naturally I ever drank for August. We claimed the water and surveyed the rout. We came home, took dinner, and went down to the Point. Got some beef and vegetables &amp;c., and ground John’s ax and the hatchet. I read for my lesson the three first chapters of Revelations.

<strong>Monday 27</strong> - We moved our penstock up the hill some to get the full length of the hose straight in a line. The hose will not be so apt to burst, and the pipe shoots harder.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Hannibal Bray came up to see us, so I left the other two at work. Noon came and we all four went and took dinner. Afterwards I did some mending on the hose and then went home with Bray. His water failed so that he can’t work. He showed me his diggins and fixtures. I got home as John arrived from work. We got gold $5; no good.</span>

<strong>Tuesday 28</strong> - I was up at day light. I saw a rat in the cabin. I called up John and we killed him, we put in our time at work very constant. We got $24.

<strong>Wednesday 29</strong> - The weather is clear and delightful. You are not disagreeably warm. Is it not strange? You scarcely even hear it thunder. Our work is pretty much the same.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I did some cutting and burned of a small heap of logs and trash. We washed and  got gold $15.50—much better than I expected. After supper I left John trimming a ham that the rats had gnawed considerably, to put it on to boil.</span>

<strong>Thursday 30</strong> - After a hearty supper and a hard day’s work I am setting in my cabin alone and making this entry and thinking about why am I not ready to start home. Maybe it is not my pleasure, well so be it.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We were piping down till noon. We concluded to cle an up the boxes and got gold $11. We then put our boxes on poles above where they were, in order to clean up the cut and make it deeper to get more fall. We have got it near half done. We did not clean up the boxes tonight, as we will have to do it at noon tomorrow.</span>

<strong>Friday 31</strong> - It was quite cool this morning. The fire felt very comfortable. We cleaned up the cut, or rather, where we’ve been at work for the last two weeks. It look us all day. We got gold $29.50.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Now, today closes the last summer day in ’55. Could I have look forward 24 years ago up to this time and saw myself, setting down to a center table of my own making, and making some of my thoughts legible, while John is amusing himself playing on the old fiddle and Roister with us &amp;c —</span>
