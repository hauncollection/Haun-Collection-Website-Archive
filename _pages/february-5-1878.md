<div style="text-indent: 6em;">My Dear Boy</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10em;">Though</div>
far away not forgotten though neglected you think
Can a mother forget her Child no never, every
feeble Prayer is nightly offered in your behalf
to him who is able to take care of my. Absent
Boy, let not the snares and temtations that
surround you, make you forget you have a soul
to save, or Heaven to obtain, Live is but a
Spare, narowing of your acquaintances that big
fair for a long Life, whens you left now fill
an early Grave. Your letters was bott received
for which I thank you, in one you said not
answer for you was on the move, the other
writen since you moved I have been a little
careless owing to a multitude of care, arrising
from a large family, but then Mollie was
writting every week or two and I knew you
was hearing from home. You wish to know
Mr Fouslee address in San francisco, last Sum
mer there was a man by the name of Waggoner
a brick layer, working on our new Court House
said he was from there and was going back
when he left your Pa gave him a letter of
Introduction to Mr Tom Fouslee of San Francisco
telling him to look out for his Boy, that you
was in Sonoma County, and might accidentaly
Stumble in on him, if so, to do what he could
for you, in the way of assisting you to get
work, it may be that man has never got
there, but you can very early find him
he did keep a large Paint Store, and was presi
dent of the Painters Club, he boarded with us
and worked for your Pa when we lived in
Lexington before you was born, I think I would
go there and see if there was any opening
before going back to Nevada. Your Pa has had
but little to do this Winter, he is now Painting
a new Hotel that is going up out at the
new Southern Depo, put up by Thompson the
Stable keeper for rent. Julia and children left
us a week ago for their new home in Jefferson
ville Indianna, Mr S has taken Charge of the
Church there, they give him a good Salery and
then he can be at home all the time, the
good sister had the house in order, a nice
hot dinner, and all kinds of Groceries laid in
when Julia got there, they write us word they
are much pleased with their new situation
little Bob your name sake is a noble looking
boy for his age, Fannie was up yesterday her Boys
are in the same places, Charlie Boots is still
with Mr Hinch. Our united love to all--
your ever affectionate and devoted Mother
