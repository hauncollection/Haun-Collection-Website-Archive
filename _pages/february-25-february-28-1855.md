<span style="margin-left: 70px;">I learnd from Whitney that the
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">vigilence committy[note]The Nelson Creek vigilance committee was in being from 1853. Though not as active as other vigilante groups at the time, the committee gave a number of notices to individuals they considered undesirable. In 1854, the group tried John Baxter in the stabbing death of Peter Taffe. After acquitting Baxter, they assisted him in escaping the authorities, angering local officials. In the winter of 1854 - 55, the committee again sought to eject several undesirable individuals from the community, and in the course of their actions, laid themselves open to a charge of robbery. Around this time, February 1855, many of the most influential men in Nelson Point were indited on this charge, including James Sherwin, J.S. Roots, Ed Sterling and others. All were baled out almost immediately, except for James Sherwin, who stubbornly refused to give bonds and remained in the Quincy jail until April. (Fariss and Smith, pg. 214 - 15.)[/note] had calld a
