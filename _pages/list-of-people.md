<h3>Family</h3>
<h6><strong>Immediate Family</strong></h6>
<a name="James Haun"></a><strong>James Humphrey Haun</strong>
<em>b. June 24 1811</em>
<em> m. September 1 1831</em>
<em> d. June 20 1890</em>
James Haun was born near Haun's Mill near Lexington in Scott County, Kentucky to John Haun and Katherine Winter. He had four younger brothers, and at least one sister. The family business was milling.

In 1831, James married Martha Hurst of Georgetown, and the couple had one son, John, born in 1834. They were active in the local Baptist church, and had many friends. Financially, the family was moderately successful, with a home and business. They were also slave owners, with four adult slaves, Betty, or 'Bett', Sam, Kitt, and Wash, and their children. However, they dreamed of having a farm of their own.

In 1853, James set out for the gold mines of California in company with his seventeen-year-old son John and his young brother Dave, with the goal of earning enough to purchase property at home. He prospected on Willow Creek near Nelson Point on the Middle Fork of the Feather River as a member of several different mining companies. Although he never struck it rich, his claims paid well. In November 1855 he was joined by his wife and her young niece Lizzie, and in 1856 purchased the 160 acre American Ranch in Quincy, which the family operated as a farm and hotel until its sale in 1876. He was an active member of the Plumas Rangers and local Democratic organizations. He passed away at the age of 78 at home in Quincy.

<a name="Martha Haun"></a><strong>Martha 'Patsy' Hurst Haun</strong>
<em>b. August 28 1811</em>
<em> m. September 1 1831</em>
Martha, known to her family as Patsy, was born in Georgetown in 1811 and married James Haun in 1831 at the age of 20. Initially she remained behind when her husband and son departed to seek their fortune in California in 1853, in order to collect remaining debts from their business, which had recently been wound up, and to look after the family's slaves.

After two years, when it became evident that settling in California was the family's best option, Martha and her niece Lizzie, who resided with her, traveled to California, escorted by her brother-in-law Dave Haun. The party was snowed up in Rabbit Creek in December of 1855, and Martha traveled the rest of the way to Nelson Creek on a hand sled. In 1856, Martha moved with her husband to the newly acquired American Ranch in Quincy.
