Dear Friend,

I should have written to you sooner but we have had no mails. Consequently it was useless to have written. You are mistaken about me saying I would not wear the ring, until somebody’s return. I said it was just put on my finger, there to remain until somebody’s return.

Buddie Holtzclaw was married to Miss Mollie Roberson on Tuesday last, a young lady that lived with Mrs Fitzgerald. They went to Louisville and are expected home this evening. Billie and Gabbie F. were round yesterday. Dora does not know of Buddie’s marriage yet. As soon as she dismissed him she left home for Henry County to take charge of a school but she will be home in two weeks. Buddie set to Miss B. very desperately after his and Dora’s falling out, and I think was very anxious to beat her marrying. He blames Ma and I with an interference, so I have heard, but Dora’s own good sense and judgement taught her that to marry a man and go onto his mother for a support was not at all congenial to her independence of character. You ask me if I would like to see your Ohio duck’s letters. I think I should if there is no secret on hand.

George and Jimmie Cantrill, Eaf Osborn, and Howard S. made us a visit about two weeks ago, just such as they made that July when you were here. Alvie West also. I shook hands with the man that is like to have been the means of your loosing your hat on that occasion. They came from L__ remained one day, and then went to C__ as before. Mrs Webb received a letter from your Ma to be forwarded on to you, which I suppose you have received. John Lemon and Rucker passed through Louisville as prisoners taken in Georgia. Jimmie Davis is also a prisoner taken at Mount Sterling.[note]Mount Sterling in Montgomery County Kentucky was the site of numerous gorilla engagements from 1861 on. Consult the <a title="Map" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/map/">map</a> for precise location.[/note] Johnny Sherritt is again taken, and sent to Johnson Island.[note]Johnson Island Ohio was the site a confederate POW camp operating from 1862 to 1865. (<a title="johnsonsisland.org" href="http://www.johnsonsisland.org/history.htm">johnsonsisland.org</a>). Consult the <a title="Map" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/map/">map</a> for precise location.[/note] It was his own imprudence, he was caught recruiting in Oweing, and his horse shot from under him.

Fannie Johnson spent a week with me. I went home with her and spent two days. We had Webb Harcourt and John Webb to chat with the first day, they were out fishing and took diner. Mr Will Crockett spent the next morning. We went down to the mill and weighed ourselves. Fannie’s weight was 101, his 171, mine 121 1/2 pounds.

Dr. Jury is going to Harrodsberg to take charge of a school there. Mr Aulghire is going to Pennsylvania to live. Mr Hinch back to Indiana. Quite a number of citizens are breaking up and leaving on account of the times. It is advisable for such as the Ganoes to leave, I guess. It was Tom Barclay's daughter I spoke of. Hat W. has been in the corn field plowing all spring as they, like most everyone else, are minus the colored help. Bob Hopkins came to see me the other day. He has taken the oath. The boys were after Johnny Beatty, hearing, his life was to have paid the penalty. I had two visitors from Lexington Sunday. They remained until after church at night, or in fact Monday morning: Mr McCann and Marsh. One is a great big fine looking fellow, the other quiet and small but handsome. McCann has the finest picture gallery in Lexington. Our acquaintance was brought about in such a funny way. Mr McCann says it is quite a little romance. It would take me too long to tell you about it, therefore I shall wait till I see you.

I think you have been in close confinement long enough to have been exchanged or released ere this. Do, for goodness sake, come and see us, or me anyhow. I want to see if you are the same Mr John Haun as when you left, or has time as in most all persons, wrought sad changes in your personal appearances?

Let me hear from you very soon. Tommie’s love to you, and Mary’s too, if agreeable. If not just send it back home again. Goodbye, may fortune favor you very soon in a release, and restoration of former privileges, as is my ardent wish,

Mollie C. Burns
