My Dearest Friend Mary,

I received your letter of the 11th yesterday evening. I hardly know how to answer it in every respect but will do it as satisfactorily as I can before I retire. I was in town today and called at your house but found no one at home but your ma. I sat down and had a very pleasant chat with her for about half an hour when Julia came in and we went to Fannie’s and found Dora there. Mrs Taylor and Mr and Ms Lemon and did not leave until the bells rung for supper at the hotels. I enjoyed myself finely, so you see Dora and myself are still taking on, but nothing serious as yet.

But you do not think I am goose enough to believe your pa embraced me because he thought anything of me. Not I. I only said so to see what you would say. I am not quite that silly yet. You also say I am very presuming. It may be so, but you take somethings I say in jest for earnest, such as: be certain you are not mistaken in regards to my sentiments toward you. I only said it to be talking and do not think you ought to give me such a blowing up over trifles, but of course you can do as you please.

Mollie, have I ever betrayed your confidence? If so I am willing to be treated as such and will not complain. I must confess such language as I used was out of place, had it of been in earnest. However it is useless to say more on this subject and will drop it for the present. I will add I am very sorry you harbor for one moment such a thought. It is true the proper time for such demonstrations is after certain rights have been performed, but thought it would do no harm hoping the time would soon come when we could enjoy each other’s society to the fullest extent. You tell me not to think yours was a love letter. Goodness knows I did not it read like anything else from the accusations it contained, or rather, enveloping certain language in doubt.

You talk of your confidence being misplaced. God knows I have never told you anything but what was strictly true, so far as loving you, for I have loved you devotedly. Perhaps it would have been better had it not of been so, but the more I knew of your kind and generous heart the more I have loved you--but enough of this.

Your ma is well. I did not do exactly as you bade, but told your ma of your fright and your jumping the fence, but told her not to be uneasy, that you was only acting a circus a little in imitation of one you visited recently.

You say if you were here you would scare away the blues. I wish you were here to see what effect your presence would produce. I think it would work like a charm upon me. Dora says she believes I love you. What do you think of that? I believe there is no news of interest in town. Nobody married or died very recently. Dora is making a very pretty picture frame and has it nearly finished. She says if I will give her my photograph she will put it in the pretty frame of her own making. I asked your pa what had become of his run away daughter and when he heard from her last. He asked me if I had not got a letter from you. He talked like he knew I had. It rather took me by surprise at first, but I told him I had two from you recently, but did not show them to him. Cliff Toppas has gone to Midway to school to fit herself for a teacher.

Ruby whenever I see Mrs Lemon I think of what she said, “my dear children I told you you had a pa.” It would be rather singular if they had not don’t you think so? You say Ruby likes her name. What do you mean? Is it the word Ruby you like so much? I think it becomes you very much as it is a pretty name.

Mrs Shelton has been very low for sometime and there is not much hope of her recovery. John Webb is here to see his mother.

You say wherever the heart is, there home is. If that is the case my home is near you and has been for some time. Ruby please answer this as soon as received and please excuse this short letter. I will do better next time if you don’t get too mad while you are writing your next one. I suppose you have heard of the death of Lincoln and Seward[note]Lincoln was shot April 14 1864 at the theatre. Simultaneously, William Seward, already injured in a carriage accident was stabbed. He recovered and continued to served until 1869.[/note] by assassination. give my regards to your cousin. I will close, while I remain your true friend and devoted lover,

J.J.H.

Written in haste. Excuse all mistakes if you please. God bless you, Ruby, forever.

P.S. Do not let any one see this. Has Jim Crumbaugh called on you recently? He left here Wednesday and I gave him directions how to find you. He said he was going to take you out riding if you would go. Treat him well for he is a particular friend of mind and a good fellow.
