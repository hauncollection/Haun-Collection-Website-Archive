<strong>Wednesday 1</strong> - Still pleasant. We went to ground sluicing--hauled on our leaky gum boots, rolled up our sleeves and into the water.

<strong>Thursday 2</strong> - Up this morning early and darned a hole in the heel of my old grey sock. We go in our shirtsleeves all day. We had a good head of water to wash off the top snow, and we rolled up our sleeves to get in to it all day.

<strong>Friday 3</strong> - Last night three lions passed within 200 yards of out cabin between it and our work, and then late this evening a fourth one came on the track of the three before. We came home from work. Somewhat cloudy this evening. Our work is the same: ground sluicing.

<strong>Saturday 4</strong> - Rained moderate today. We set up our boxes after digging them up put of the snow. It is knee deep and hard enough to bear in places. Well if this ain’t cold work on hands! I will say no more.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We quit for the day after getting up the boxes and being wet all over from working in the rain. We were quite late for dinner. After dinner I changed my duds for dry ones and went down to the Point. I got a letter of date 28 November[note]Not included in this collection.[/note] for John and one for me of the date 29 November[note]Martha Haun's letter of November 29 1853 has been preserved and is available <a title="November 29 1855" href="www.hauncollection.org/version-3/version-iii-series-ii/november-29-1853-martha-haun-to-james-haun/">here</a>.[/note]. It mostly says don’t be discouraged.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Well, if you could see us at work you would have no occasion to write such letters, I think.</span>

<strong>Sunday 5</strong> - Rained all night last and all of today. We all went to McDonald’s cabin. He was not at home. I closed tonight by reading from Saint Mark from the 7th chapter ---

<strong>Monday 6</strong> - Rained and snowed last night; mixed and rained all day. We went to washing out gold, $11.25. This is the first since the middle of December last, and not bad for a start. I made a cape out of the legs of gum boots that kept my shoulders dry all day.

<strong>Tuesday 7</strong> - Rained last night. I was up this morning before day. It cleared up at daybreak and sun came out. Beautiful all day. We got gold $23.50, not bad for three of us.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I had some cross words with John this morning. He has got in the habit of telling me that I’m mad if I speak to him in the way of a reprimand. He did not go out to work until I came back after him.</span>

<strong>Wednesday 8</strong> - Fine day. Cold last night, some cloudy this evening. We washed for gold this morning for two hours and got $41, one piece weighing $29. Then we went to ground sluicing the rest of day.

<strong>Thursday 9</strong> - Some cloudy. Ground sluicing. Commenced raining at bedtime.

<strong>Friday 10</strong> - Snowed some last night and rained pretty hard all day. We were ground sluicing, and got wet and cold at that.

<strong>Saturday 11</strong> - Rained hard last night and then snowed before day. We got gold $9. It was a beautiful sunshiny day, but cool this evening.

<strong>Sunday 12</strong> - Cold last night and cloudy. Snowing this morning very fast and continued all day. About a foot of new fallen snow on the top of the old and hard snow.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">All three of us went down to the Point. I mailed my 8th letter to my wife. I paid $3.50 for sharpening two picks, putting steel in one of the ends and drawing them out out of the ends and drawing them out. Out of the company’s money, 50 cents for turpentine for company. Paid Lewis and Roots $17 for John’s boots and letters. I got a blue flannel shirt on credit. It was still snowing at bedtime.</span>

<strong>Monday 13</strong> - Snowed some little last night and all of the day, with sunshine at intervals. Cold and Freezing tonight. We got gold today $10.50. The south west side of ravine bank slid down with four small trees on it and split two of our sluice boxes. It took us all the afternoon to right it.

<strong>Tuesday 14</strong> - Cold last night and continues to freeze in the shade and where we are at work. Got gold $34.50 our piece weighed $24.50.

<strong>Wednesday 15</strong> - Cold last night, but pleasant today, sunshine in the forenoon but cloudy in the after, and snowed a little. We got gold $24.50. We had flapjacks for dinner as bread was scarce.

<strong>Thursday 16</strong> - Snowed some last night. The sun shone but it was dim, hazy and cloudy. Today we got gold $16. My shoulders and elbows ache and my hands are rough and cracked.

<strong>Friday 17</strong> - Fine day, the wind is from the North East. Got gold $23.50. We think we’ve found diggins that will last for months.

<strong>Saturday 18</strong> - Fine and warm day. We cleaned off the trees and bushes for ground sluicing. We cut a ditch and got the water running through. We cleaned out the pattern riffle box and got gold $2.50. I saw a large flock of wild geese going north--what does it mean?

<strong>Sunday 19</strong> - Snowed a little last night and is at it today. Some sunshine at intervals. Wild geese going south again. We cut and packed wood. I cut a tree and felled it in front the cabin, close for back logs. My lesson is Acts, Chapter 20.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I sent John down to the Point to have my pick sharpened and see if there was any letters. I took five pills made by Barlow’s receipt last night, as I am out of sorts--rather bilious.</span>

<strong>Monday 20</strong> - Cloudy mostly, with a little snow. Wild geese and ducks going north. I took four more pills on going to bed last night and felt rather bad all day, but worked all day at ground sluicing. The bank caved in and smashed one of out boxes badly. We found it so when we went to work this morning.

<strong>Tuesday 21</strong> - Snowed a little last night and all day today but melted as it fell. We were ground sluicing but fixed our boxes in the afternoon for catching gold. We saved some but did not weigh it.

<strong>Wednesday 22</strong> - Snowed last night and is falling fast this morning, but melts almost as fast as it falls. We did not work. I patched my new red shirt with some of the old one. It snowed hard all day and night following ---

<strong>Thursday 23</strong> - and was at it this morning, hard, for a while. Cleared off nice and warm. The snow is knee deep again though it melted away and fell off the trees powerful fast. We went to work in the snow and got gold $42.

<strong>Friday 24</strong> - Another storm brewing cloudy and cool. Got gold $9. We were ground sluicing in the afternoon, or rather clearing away all day.

<strong>Saturday 25</strong> - Commenced snowing before day and is at it still at 9 o’clock. Dobson is mixing up dough and John is cutting off the hock bone of a ham to boil. I’ve just fixed up the fire and noted these little facts while I think and reflect on one that I love and O, how I should like to see her.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We went to work. There was a pile of top dirt slid down last night that we had to move. We shoveled it in the boxes. It snowed on us till 2:00 P.M. when the sun came out and it quit snowing. We was wet, cold and hungry. We got gold $3.50.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Built a good fire changed clothes, ate dinner and then turned out to get wood. I had to shovel off the snow before I could cut a back log. It commenced snowing in a short time and continued till night.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Now after dark. Dobson baking bread. John cleaning out his tin kettle to cook a mess of beans and I have just read from the 5th to the 10th chapter of First Corinthians, and am now noting this down, that I may see how the time has passed.</span>

<strong>Sunday 26</strong> - Snowed all night and all day. Dobson and I went down to the Point. I paid Roots $4 for a long handled shovel, 75 cents for 2 pounds nails, and paid the smith $1 for sharpening a pick. I expected to get a letter but the mail had not come in. We waded back through the snow in places. I broke through and it was up between my knees and hips.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">It is not cold, nor has been for the quantity of snow that is on the ground and falling so often. It melts away nearly as fast as it falls. The wind blows but little compared to other places and the days are nearly always warm.
I shall read a chapter or two and then go to bed, as it is late.</span>

<strong>Monday 27</strong> - Rained and snowed all of last night and continued this morning until 10 o’clock, and then it snowed till after night. Yes, it fell faster than I ever saw before. It is more than hip deep.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We brought in our new patten riffle box. I made some alterations. That was all we done today. It continued snowing till after dark and I can’t say how much longer.</span>

<strong>Tuesday 28</strong> - Cold this morning. We waded through the snow and carried our new patent riffle box to where we intend to work, as it was a fine sunshiny, warm morning. We fixed the boxes till noon and then went up the ditch in several places. We cleared off the snow and mended the broken places and got the water to running in the ditch.
