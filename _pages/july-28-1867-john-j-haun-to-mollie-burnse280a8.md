Miss Mollie,

Dearest one, after trying for a good many days to ascertain if possible your whereabouts without success, I have concluded to venture a letter at any rate, directed to Lexington. I received your letter dated July 10th[note]This letter has been preserved and is available <a title="July 10 1867" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/version-iii-series-ii/july-10-1867-mollie-burns-to-john-j-haun%E2%80%A8/">here</a>.[/note] stating your were about starting for C. Mr Jenkins received one last Thursday saying you was coming to Paris and then to Lexington. Do you see why I did not know where to write, not withstanding what you told me you would be in Lexington the next week. But I thought your nieces would prevail on you to stay with them longer than you calculated, which I think is perfectly right on your part. Stay with them awhile as you go so seldom to see them and probably it might be the last visit you will make them for sometime, as somebody expects to take a trip soon. But why did you not write to me while at Lexington, so as I could know where and when I could answer your letter? I am always glad to write to some people, even if they do not weight but little.

Town is very dull now. Warren Johnson was buried yesterday at 3:00 at the cemetery and Brad Rankin today—two deaths right together. Warren’s was a disease of the heart. Brad had been lingering for a long time. Warren was a clever boy. I suppose his mother takes it very hard, him being the youngest of the family, but such things will be.

I suppose you have enjoyed yourself finely at C.[note]Covington, KY[/note] I know you found a new sweetheart in your rounds and have nearly for gotten the old one—but the old one has not forgotten Ruby. I was at your home a few nights ago and stayed until after eleven with your ma and talked about many things as you advised me to while you were gone. She told something of you that I was not aware of, something you told her concerning myself and Ruby. Now you told me you never said anything to her concerning it, never mind she said it had cost her several sleepless nights on account of it, but said it was all right now. So you see I took you at your word that time. I expect you will be afraid to come home anymore won’t you?

I have been pretty sick since you left for several days but am about well again. What is Dora doing and where is she gone to service? Some other county? Most everyone asks me when you are coming home, and if I ain’t lonesome while you are gone. I have been sitting to Julie. I have been to Fannie’s twice to see them. Fanny has been right sick for several days but is getting better, and the baby is getting sick. The boys have formed a brass band and are practicing every night or so.

I saw your cousin Fannie last week in a buggy on the other side of June Ward’s. I suppose she was coming to them to see her sister. I did not stop. It looked like Mrs Marvin with her. I suppose you heard Jim Long had a baby left at his door some time since—but you will hear all the news when you get home if you don't stay too long. Emma Jenkins left yesterday to take a visit for a month to Louisville and she will get to see Porter, I suppose, while there. Your pa, Frank and I are going fishing Monday night out at T. Holding’s mill to catch cats.[note]Catfish.[/note] Don't you wish you were here to help eat some if we get any.

I want to see Ruby so much. A dozen kisses would not be a circumstances for me to steal at one time. Write as soon as you get this and tell me when you are coming home. I want to see you so much but I don't wish to hurry you home before you are ready to come, so goodbye till I see you. With a sweet kiss as ever, your lover, I subscribe myself your J…
