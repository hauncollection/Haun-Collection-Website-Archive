Th 23          upper    each 1$   2 00

Fr 24           Breckfast    "     1$   2 00
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">1 pair blankets           ---    8 00
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">1 pan Iron for wash gold 2 00
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">6 lbs meat &amp; bread 2.40
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">Old virginia John &amp; I started up
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">N. Creek to prospect.  We called a hault
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">at independence 2 1/2 miles at noon
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">we crosd N. Creek &amp; took up Diskson
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">Creek washed out several pans &amp;
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">got the couler every pan.[note]When panning, miners would place dirt and gravel in the bottom of the pan, add water, and gently shake the pan back and forth, loosening the gravel and soil and allowing the heavier gold to sink to the bottom of the pan. When the water became cloudy, the miners would gently pour out the muddy water and resume with fresh. This process would be repeated about 10 or 20 times. The miner would then rinse the bigger rocks and pebbles and discard them.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>

In the next step, the miner would continue shaking the pan, this time tilting it to the side so that any gold might sink to the crease where the sides of the pan meets its base. From there, the miner would begin "washing." Holding the pan almost perpendicular to the water, he would submerge it and then gently lift it out of the water, letting the top layers of dirt and gravel slide away.

When only the finest sand was left in the pan, the miner would add a small amount of water and gently rotate, causing the sand to wash to one side of the pan, leaving the heavier gold beached on the opposite end. After several rounds of this, the gold would be isolated from the majority of the remaining sand. At that point, gently wobbling the pan with a very small amount of water would enable the miner to separate the last of the gold.[/note] Old vir
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">ginia said it would not do.  We
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">came down again N.  Creek &amp;
