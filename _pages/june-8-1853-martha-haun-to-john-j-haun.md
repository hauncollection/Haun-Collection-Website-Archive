<span style="margin-left: 480px;">June the 9th 1853</span>

My own dear son,

How often in my imagination do I see your loved form and features, hear the sweet tones of your voice. It seems that I can hear you say “ma,” so plain at times--and then to think that you are so far from me, and the fear and dread that I may never see you again on earth seems to pierce my very soul. But I will not, nor do not, indulge nor give way to these feelings no more than I can help--for if I did I would go deranged or die.

I keep in company all I can to keep from steadying or indulging in melancholy. It is the only way I can get along. Every one is kind to me and I see a good deal of company. My health is better than is was when you left, or for two months after. My health was bad after you left, and I fell off until I  was quite poorly but ever since I received your pa’s letter informing me of your safe arrival.

I have been fattening up again and am quite cheerful--but, oh, the uneasiness I suffered until I heard you had arrived safely! I have tried these many years to learn to look on the bright side of the picture, my sense and better judgement teaching me that there is no advantage in any way derived from being always in trouble under any circumstances. When I think that our object is a good one, and that we all believed it to be for the best, I try to be satisfied. If I could only know that you and your pa was happy and satisfied I could stand anything--but I fear that you are unhappy or disappointed or sick or something else. Oh, my dear son, if we can all be spared to meet again and be able to get us a home that we can make a living on I think I will be the happiest being on earth.

Do you and your pa make it your object to get money enough to buy a farm of  two hundred acres and come home as quick as possible. Just think how happy and independent we could be places in that situation. I do try to preserve my health so that I will not look so old and broken that you will not know me. Tell your pa not to listen or be swayed by the opinions of others, for it has never done him any good but a great deal of
harm, and you and him consult each other and lay your own plans and do not be persuaded against your views, but have an object in view to accomplish and make every effort to do it. I know of nothing that would be so much honor to you or more satisfaction than to come back here able to by a farm.

Mary Chambers did not get further than New Orleans. She is now at home and there is some talk of her and Will Wood marrying. I got a letter from Minerva last March, she is well and sends her love to you. She is going to the Worlds Fair[note]The 1853 World’s Fair was held in what is now Bryant Park in Manhattan between 5th and 6th Avenues and 40th and 42nd streets.[/note] this summer. I was at Sam Thompson’s last Friday and Sand told me to give you her best love. Sam says he is certain to go to Missouri this fall and Ben Finnell is going to leave this fall to Nashville or Memphis, I do not know which. Newport went home two months a go to come back in two or three weeks to marry Ellen, and that is the last of him. Ellen is not very popular with old or young; she has no attention from the boys at all. Johny Johnson is here; he has been for some weeks.

I was at Frankfort last week and heard that he was dismissed. He kept it very secret he is not going back any more. General Pratt took his wife, myself, and Mrs Holtzclaw, and Lizzie down on a pleasure trip--

Nat Saunders starts to Missouri in a few days to look for a place and Mooreland, I believe, goes also--Weeb Boss will not give him a deed today of the place unless he pays for it, and he has not got any money to do that. If Mrs Saunders, Nat and Betty live a few years, they will be as poor as anybody, for there are none of them making anything, and they are all very extravagant. They are bound to come to poverty. Bat Thompson’s wife is not expected to live. There is a talk of Gasner and Sarah Chambers marrying.

Georgetown is duller than you ever saw it, I think. It has gone by the board. I was at Mrs Smarr’s yesterday. Mrs Johnson and Bled’s wife came by and took me in the carrier. Mrs Smarr is in very bad health. Mrs Johnson took me last week to spend the day with Mrs Patterson.

I ride about more than I ever did in my life, first one and then another comes for me, so I am half my time or more gone. Everyone is kind to me and everything done to make me happy by my friends, and I am, with the exception of being so far from you and your pa. Oh, how could I be entirely happy when I think of the distance that is between us, and, oh, how often does the thought cross my mind that maybe you are suffering either in body or mind, and, oh, God, how miserable I feel.

My son, write to me and do not disguise anything but let me know your exact situation. I have been looking for a letter better than two weeks and none yet. Your pa said you would write in two weeks after he started his letter. You do not know what a comfort your pa’s letter was to me, letting me know you had got safe there.

Your uncle Moore has torn down all of his house but one room and is building. The kin are all well. Poor Gus Barley is dead. Dan Renion made an attempt to run off with Sally Blackburn last week, but her father Dr Churchhill Blackburn caught her and keeps her locked up ever since. Letty Holtzclaw has gone over to Madison to see Eli and Tom that are in jail there. Mrs Holtzclaw told me today that that they had heard where Henry was and had gone on the brunt of him to bring him to justice. The family is in great trouble about them.

Now, my sweet child, I must close this letter. I cannot write all the names of persons that says give my love to John and Mr Haun when you write, but just know that is everyone. You have no idea how many seems to feel an interest in your welfare, and let me tell you if you can only come back with a few thousand dollars it will place us at once on a full level with the very best. My associates are of the best and they appear to think a great deal of me. Take care of yourself, my son, and remember the time will soon pass off, and if you are successful it will place you in a situation to live comfortable and your energy and enterprise will give you a standing in this community with the very best--

Give my love to all of them that are kind to you and to your dear pa. Be kind to him and give him my my love. Do write (you and him). Farewell my darling.

Your devoted mother until death,

M. Haun
