Miss Mollie C.B., [note]Mollie's initials were M.C.B., Mollie Chalk Burns.[/note]

I thought you would like to hear from an old acquaintance, the fate of which no doubt you have already learned ere this. This being the first time I have had the pleasure of writing to you, I sincerely hope you will not think I am presuming too much by taking the liberty of penning you a few lines, knowing you to have been guilty of a correspondence with a bachelor suffering the same fate as myself, why not correspond with another? Knowing your goodness of heart I take it for granted you say yes.

It is useless to give an account of my trip, as the papers will do that in a much smaller space and better style than I can. Suffice it to say the bulk of our command took up its abode in this delightful place the 26th of July.[note]July 26 1863 was the date of the battle of Salineville, Ohio, during Morgan’s Raid, a Union victory.[/note] I would like to see you and them and could say as much as I liked but as it is we are limited to a certain space, and that very small as you will see. We have been treated very well so far and I hope it will continue while we remain here. I was captured near Cheshire[note]Consult the <a href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/map/">map</a> for precise location.[/note] on the Ohio River the 20th of July[note]Captain Thomas Monroe Coombs of the 5th Kentucky Cavalry, captured the same day at the same location, reported that his command, along with Logan’s 6th were engaged against Woolford and Judah. With their ammunition exhausted and the river at their backs, the Confederates were forced to surrender. (Coombs)[/note] but not until my faithful animal, your namesake, gave out—so I surrendered. John Herritt, Howard Graves, Clem Nutter and Sinia Harris are with me.

I would like to take a peep at that picture I left with you when I left town but would much rather see the original. As there is no chance of that for the present I would content myself with the picture, but I suppose I will have to content myself without the sight of either. Well, such is life’s injustice. Webb said you made some inquiries about me but he had not time to go into particulars.

I must close as I have finished the allotted space. Write as soon as you get this, your friend,

J.J.H.

P.S. Direct letters to Camp Chase prison No., 3.
