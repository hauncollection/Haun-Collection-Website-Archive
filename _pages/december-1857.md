Hogan as captain. The militia was formed in response to rumors of unrest among the Indians. 82 local men were enrolled and officers were elected at a meeting at the Saloon of Flournoy &amp; Company in Elizabethtown on Saturday December 1 but the expected attack never came. The Rangers participated in no action other than parades and drills until conflict arose between white settlers and Pit River Indians in the Honey Lake region in 1857. With food in short supply, the local Indians harvested three acres of potatoes belonging to local rancher William Morehead. The resulting conflict became known as the Potato War. The Plumas Rangers marched to the aid of the settlers, but found the conflict already quelled by United States Army troops under Captain William Weatherlow and Chief Winnemucca and the Pah-Utes, who assisted in tracking the Pit River Indians involved. The group disbanded in 1860. (www.militarymuseum.org/plumasrangers) (Fariss, pg 282 -283)[/note] met in Quincy and was drilled some by Captain Cunningham. Lawyer Haydon was married to Miss Story this evening at Betsy Town, a runaway match the girl is 16 and the boy 32. Quite romantic.</span>
