Dear Sister,

I received your letter the 8th of this month[note]James Haun did not record writing this letter in his diary.[/note]. I have been waiting for Mr Moore to go to Georgetown before I would write to you. He was there yesterday and saw Betty. She said they were all well and doing well. He hired Kit to Mr Alexander Chresnas for sixty dollars. He was to clothe her and pay her taxes. He thinks she has got a very good place if she will behave herself. I did not know that you had gone for two weeks. Sam brought your note out but I was gone to church and did not see him. Kit lives within about 2 miles of here at Charles Buford’s old farm.

You never said anything about hearing from Mr Haun and John in your letter. I would like very much to hear from them. I have been dreaming some good dreams about their coming home this winter. I am in hopes they will come true. Patsy, I would be very glad if you and Lizzie would come by John’s and see him, if you do not think it would be too expensive to you. I should like very much to hear from him and know he is getting along. We have never heard a word from him since you left here. I was very glad to hear you and Liz was enjoying yourselves out there, but have been a little uneasy for fear of the cold not agreeing with you both.

I have not been to Georgetown since you left and therefore cannot tell you any news from there. I have not seen any of our kin but hear from them occasionally. They are all well, or was a few days ago. I have got very sore eyes and can scarcely see to write today at all. Tell Liz that Ely and Bryan talk a heap about seeing her, and I would like to see her and hear about her trip. I imagine sometimes I can almost see her galloping through the woods on a horse for I know that would please her better than almost anything else.

Write as soon as you get this and let me know when you expect to come home and how. I have nothing more to write at present.

I remain your affectionate Sister,

Elizabeth C Moore
