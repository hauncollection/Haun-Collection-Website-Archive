Mr J. J. Haun, dearest of friends,

As I cannot see you tonight, which I should like to do very much, I consequently have concluded to write, being desirous to know if you are convalescent or still an invalid. You must take better care of yourself for somebody’s sake, if not your own.

I have been attending church every night Mr Walk from Paris has been holding a protracted meeting at your church. He has made a good many additions to the church; they immerse them just below here and quite a number of the girls at the orphan school have joined. They come here to dress after being immersed, Clifford and some of the older girls came with them. I have been to see her often, and have a chat every night after church. She says if you should come down and do not come to see her she would never forgive you.

I entertain my beaus in regular country style, having accommodations for both man and beasts. Dick T. came in last Sunday evening, had his horse put up, took supper, and we then went to church, came home and he stayed till ten o’clock. I was not aware that you were criticizing me the night of the circus, or that I was exciting any feelings of admiration in the breast of the one I desired most to please on that occasion. You speak of one of the managers assisting me to a seat and putting his arm around my waist; the seats were very unsteady, which was the reason he did it. I intended to ask you if you noticed it but something prevented and it then slipped my memory. I did not know you noticed it. Did Joe and Millie see it, or did you speak of it to them? I would just have that show man to know, that my waist is not to be considered public property to be encircled by anybody that might choose to do so.

Cousin Fannie and myself will be over one day next week to spend the day, but do not know what day, as we are controlled by circumstances but I expect to return with her as I have given her my promise to stay, and help her quilt and do some of her fall sewing. I received a letter from home the same day yours came. Cousin Fannie is very nicely fixed down here, and if you choose to come down one day and stay till the next I think you would enjoy your visit very much. Cousin Fanny is a great hand for young folks and takes a great deal of pain to entertain my visitors. We both have our own fun together. She says she is going to inform you of my flirting with the country boys down here. I tell her that it would just please you to know I am enjoying myself.

I have been quite well but have another sore tooth. Cousin Fannie made me take a bottle of camphor, one of laudanum and a bottle of whiskey to my room one night to try the soothing influence of all, but to no effect. The pain still predominates. I seen stars for certain until, being worn out, after midnight I just concluded to drink whiskey until it put me to sleep. Cousin F. makes us all get up so soon, but that morning she said she felt so sorry for me. hearing one pace my floor, she let me sleep as long as I wanted to.

Sallie McConnell, now Mrs Waits, is at church every night. She is now living out in the country at her husband’s father’s home. I have become acquainted with her new brother and sisters, and like them very much. There is rather a large family and most of them grown. They seemed to be thought a great deal of here.   But as I am getting sleepy I shall close, biding you good night. I shall simply reply verbatim to the signature of your missive,

Write soon and often,

Mollie
