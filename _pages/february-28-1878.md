Dear dear Husband
<div style="text-indent: 12em;">I shall do as</div>
you did in yorus, first chronickle the fact that all of us
are well, as we feel this with papa will be the most
interesting item, this morning is clear, frosty and bright
weather to be desired, in point of health &amp; like yourselves
we have had a warm rainy, sickly winter. I am thank
full that we so far have escaped thare has been
scarlet fever, all over portions of Ky. Tell Ma I have
not been to Aunt Lizzie Moores consequently have not
answered her letter, as I thought she would want to
hear from thare. Brian called to see me, on yesterd
ay was here, also on court day but I was at Fannies
they have lost their second child Thornly with the
scarlet fever named for Unckle Moore he doted on
him, called him Sannly for pet name, he was
2 years 7 months, their oldes Maggie has ben as low
with Pnewmonia as she could be to live, that
was earlier in the winter, and since Thornlies death has
had the fever in a light for me. The babie 7 months
has not as yet had it. Aunt Lizzie was with them
in their offliction. And I htought it not best to
go thare. Brian seemed to feel deeply, while relate-
ing their troubles. I should think Lizzies youngest are
liable to it, but they put him away with out ceremons
of funeral, used disenfectents, took him to the Lexington
Cemetry his wife had a sister to die of consumption, and
the Nigrow nurse contracted the disease first, from parties
at the funeral, out from Lexington. Ellies children are
all well Brian said Aunt Lizzie was so anxious to hear
from my chidlren we keep them very close. It is in only
three families in town that I know of, Hue Oneals

George W Johnson. Aunt Ell says it is all in her eye, that
