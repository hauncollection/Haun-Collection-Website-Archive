My Dear Friend,

For the first time I take my pen in hand to address you in the new year, namely, 1865. Although it still finds you a prisoner, and as every successive year brings its changes. May its change in store for you be from prison boundaries to freedoms and enjoyment which lets us wander where we will, regardless of all limits.

I had a short chat with Mrs Webb this morning. She inquired after you and said that Mr Will Caumbaugh had come to her for your address, that they had heard from your parents and wished to send you some things. She gave him the address which she sent to me for Barracks Number 7 instead of Number 1. I suppose it will be all right.

As we have had no material change since the election your parents will come. John F. Bucker is here. He took the oath and was released from prison. It seems to me if you were a cousin or brother of mine  I think I should have had you out of there long ago. You think your friends will want you to come home immediately and wish me to tell you what I think of it. I believe I have already told you my opinion. Anyhow you shall not have it the second time till I know of what weight or consequence it would be with you. There now you have my answer. Nattie Hokins is having her wedding clothes made. She marries a Lieutenant Foster from Louisville Missouri. Everyone says she will do very well. You think the young folks of Georgetown are trying to see which will marry first and wonder that Ruby has not taken flight ere this. You should know that she never commits any rash acts.

I attended the funeral of Maud Johnnson’s wife this morning. Fannie Causey that was there. Mary Ellen Fitzgerald was also put in the vault yesterday week. Both died with fever. They were down some six or eight weeks. Silas C., Joe E., and Frank A. are still on hand.

I have such a cold I cannot speak above a whisper. Don’t you now it goes hard with me when I can't talk. There was a Mr Parks to see me from the country yesterday. I had to set up and whisper to him all the time he had a good laugh at me. He said when I first went in that he thought someone was dying or he had gotten into the wrong house. But as I fear I am going outside of my bounds I must close. Oh, for a good long chat, to tell you all the news.

I have not forgotten the picture. I like to have forgotten to tell you. You remember the nice basket of peaches received by me one evening when you were here, sent by Johnnie Kidd? Well he is married too--don’t you feel sorry for me?

My love to somebody's big baby.

Write soon.

Your friend,

Mollie C Burns
