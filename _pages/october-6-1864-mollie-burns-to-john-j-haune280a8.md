Dear Friend,

Answering your letter of the 8th of September,[note]Not included in this collection.[/note] which was received in due time, was necessarily delayed, on account of my being away from home. I am not at all well this morning after spending a restless night. I do not think I would possibly feel like writing to any one excepting you this morning, feeling as indisposed as if I do. I hope that these lines may find you well that Prison walls may not deprive you of your health as well as liberty. I have just gotten back from Lexington. A party of youngsters was going down to Cincinnati. Some my relations insisted on me going, and of course I went. We attended Pike’s Opera House which I suppose you have seen. We remained there two days and as we came back I stopped in Paris all night and day, came on to Lexington remained there several days, and am now at home. My loosing a great deal of sleep and traversing those long streets to see sights generally (we would not avail ourselves of the great accommodation, (street cars) as we went to see them has almost laid me up.

Mollie Crockett and Tom Long marry next week at the Reform church on Tuesday. I told you in my last of Annie Barkley’s and Well’s and Jim Samuel and Peggie Patterson’s weddings. I do not know whether they were torn off or not.

You ask me if Ruby is not glad to hear of anything to entertain you. I told them if I only had a permit to get in prison I should go on to Columbus to see some of my friend there. Would you not have been surprised! I have been as close as Cincinnati anyhow. You say you would like to have somebody’s photograph; when somebody has them taken you shall have one. I have just dropped a few lines to Mrs Webb and send you her reply. We have no news. I should like to write you a longer letter, but must obey rules. Write immediately, and I will respond as soon as received. Please accept all, no divisions--or your words in your last, just imagine I make use of the same words, and don’t forget,

Mollie C Burns

Miss Mollie

I have received no letter from Mr Haun or his mother since June. Give him my kindest regards and say to him should I receive a letter from his mother I will forward it to him immediately.

Respectfully,
A.S. Webb
