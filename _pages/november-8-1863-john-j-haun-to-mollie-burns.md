Dearest Friend,

Yours of the 29th was received in due time, and as you may judge was perused with deep interest coming from the source it did. In the first place I am truly thankful for your sympathy on my behalf, not supposing it to be of any benefit to me here but shows your willingness to use a military phrase to give “aid and comfort to a fellow being in affliction.” “In the words shows your heart to be in the right place.”

I received a letter from Jimmie Crumbaugh the same day I wrote you the one proceeding this[note]Likely the letter of October 21 1863.[/note], but had not room to mention it to you. So you will please tell him I have received and answered his letter with promptness and dispatch for I haven’t the least doubt but you will see him very very often. Judging from the tone of his letter to me I advised him to visit you often, for I thought you would prove quite entertaining. He wrote very much like a man in what do you call it? Love, I believe. At least, it looked so to a blind man. I suppose you had a fine time at Mr Crumbaugh’s? It is a wonder you never visited Miss Fannie before. She used to plague me a great deal about one certain Miss Mollie—you can guess who—but I presume she did not mention that, my sweetheart. Pretty girls sell cheap in your section of the county—only fifteen cents. I would give twenty in confederate myself for one likely girl such as yourself. Just think of it only fifteen cents!

I am glad to hear you are learning to ride so well. Probably I will get to take a ride with you one of these days, who knows. I have never received but one letter from Jimmie. I shall certainly write to him as you desire it. Well who would have thought it. I have more reasons to expect an invitation to your wedding now than ever. So you spoke to Hat? Your heart of stone has melted at last and you have condescended so far as to incline that head from its usual dignified posture. The “Goody Gracious”? So much for that. You are trying to get on the good side of Hat to get a bid to his wedding; that is right. Do you think I would get one if I was there? You are going to Mr Tugman’s to spend a week again. Will I ever forget our visit to that delightful place I think not, and the times we used to go serenading there. Give my regards to Miss Alice and tell her we will give her another serenade one of these days.

You ask me if I would not like to go with you. You know I would, but you should not tantalize a fellow in that way because Uncle Sam sees fit to pay my board for a stated period of time. My regards to Dora and tell her I am sorry I caused Buddie to leave her presence so suddenly, but if she will pardon me I will never do so again. Also tell her I would like to get a peep at that jolly good natural looking face of hers.

Mollie, I will try and have M.C.B put on your ring by the silver smith if I can. It is a silver band forming half moon at each end with a silver star nearly touching each half moon. But I had no business of saying anything about it for fear something might happen that would prevent you from getting it—but I will not send it until I am certain you will get it.[note]It was fairly common for POWs to amuse themselves in prison by making rings, pins and other small items, either for sale or as gifts.[/note]

Of course I am proud to receive a letter from you. If not why would I show it? Writing a pretty hand is very well but it is not the only accomplishment necessary for a young lady to posses in order to appear to advantage. I did not look at the hand writing altogether, but at qualities of more importance. Perhaps you call this a pretty hand; if you do you can not judge for me. Please do not show this to any one for I am nervous today and cannot write.

Give my kindest regards to my Ellen S., if convenient, and, Mollie, I must come to a close. I employ in time my making rings &amp;c &amp;c I have just finished five or six for an old gentleman for presents to his daughters. He lives near Richmond, Kentucky. Tell Chalk she writes such a sweet little letter. While I remain your true friend,

J.J.H

P.S. Please excuse this this poorly written production, Mollie. Answer this as soon as received. You did not tell me what had become of Mrs Seely, your particular friend. I shall certainly commit another theft if opportunity offers. Do you care?
