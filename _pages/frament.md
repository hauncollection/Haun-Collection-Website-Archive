to say to you to get money from your Uncle WG
&amp; come home. he wants to see you &amp; he will pay it
to him again he says come &amp; see us any how &amp; if
you do not want to stay you can go back in a year
or less time he says tell Sam and Letty to get a long this
best they can until you come back, but your Pa thinks
it is folly to think of the negroes ever doing us any
more good he says our intrest is all here now &amp;
we have got a plenty &amp; are doing well &amp; we ought to
take care of it &amp; employ it &amp; if you are here all would
be right &amp; we would know what to do. as things are
we are at a great loss. for it is for you &amp; your enjoy
ment that we are working. you are young &amp; if you
do not want to stay here after coming out you can very
easily go back but we want to see you so much &amp;
you can come with out making any sacrifice but we
canot go without making a great sacrifice. your Pa says
why dont you write what you want to do. he canot tell
from the way you write what you want to do he
says come out &amp; tell him plain what you want to do
sometimes we think you want to marry &amp; a gain
you have us in the dark about that so make up your
particly &amp; let us know. if you can get a long respectable
there &amp; want to stay a while longer &amp; can enjoy your self
let us know what your wish is. we canot nor ought we
to sacrifice our property here for I ful certain that we are
doing much better here than they th most of people are doing
there. so if you have a girl in view make your arange
ments with her to bring her a long or wait until you can
come home &amp; go back again for her. we want you to
use your own pleasure but let us know what it is
&amp; we will be gratified. So I hope you will be plain
with us there is an oposition line runing now.
Faulkner went home from here a few weeks since
got second cabin passage for forty dollars.
you asked how many children Jack left. three them
twins &amp; a boy I do not know what broke him reck
lesness I suppose he drank very hard. Derick
was intirely broke when he left here none of us ever
hear from them we heard for a while after they left
but they have quit writing to James. bil Raines is living
in town yet works hard would soon get well of
if he would quit spreeing he is not half so bad
as he was before he married. Dave is still here
he was a candidate on the Democratic ticket for
district attorney but got beatten. he seems to be
at a loss to know what to get at I think it is high time
he was doing something for him self. if you come
bring my silkes with you &amp; I would like to have the things
in that box if I could get them there is a lot of new sheeting
&amp; towels pillow cases &amp; quilts the last quilt your grandma ever
pieced is there. if you can bring them I would be
glad. go &amp; tell your Aunt Sally to send me a pair or
two of the hold home made blankets to look at for old
times sake &amp; a coverlet if you canot bring them take them out
to your Aunt Liz or Aunt Sally for safe keeping. if you come
try &amp; get Sam and Betty in as good a fix as you can until we go back
&amp; tell them you will write to them while you are gone, your Pa
says he would not if he was you rent a place there unless you
