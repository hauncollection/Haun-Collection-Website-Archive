Apr 58

<span style="margin-left: 70px;">after dark we had a meeting
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">in court house to pass res
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">olutions to sustain Duglass
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">in his course against the
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">Lecompton Kasas swindle[note]Drafted at Lecompton, Kansas in 1857, the Lecompton Constitution was one of four proposed constitutions for the state of Kansas. It would have made Kansas a slave state. The proposal was called into question for several reasons.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">First, the delegates who drafted the document represented only a small portion of the population of the Kansas territory, and the selection of delegates was heavily biased in favor of proponents of slavery. Secondly, residents of Kansas territory were not given an opportunity to vote for or against the constitution as whole. Instead, a referendum was held in which voters were given a choice between two alternative solutions to the slavery question: one was unabashedly pro-slavery, the other, misleadingly labeled as "no slavery," restricted the import of new slaves but protected existing slaveholders in the state. In either case, slavery would exist in Kansas; it was merely a question of the extent. As a result, many Free-Soil antislavery voters boycotted the polls, and the slavery version was approved.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Lecompton was strongly supported by the Democrat President Buchanan and the main party. A contingency of Northern Democrats lead by Stephen Douglas broke with the party to oppose it on the grounds that the drafting and voting process was fraudulent, and in opposition to popular sovereignty. The controversy was as this time popularly known as the 'Lecompton Swindle.'
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">In 1858 an election was held in which, not merely the slavery clauses, but the whole Lecompton Constitution was submitted to popular vote and decisively overturned. Kansas joined the union as a free state in 1861.[/note]
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">but it was no go. I pd the
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">express 3 1/4$ for services &amp; 2 1/4
