Su 9             alls well wife is getting a
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">long as well as could be ex
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">pected dislikes to be a lone or
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">without me cant be helpd, the
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">grand Jury closd its session last
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">kt at 10 p.m. &amp; at about 2 p.m.
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">I, Mack &amp; Bill Mackmanaway
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">started for the cabin was there
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">before sun down had supper
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">the two Mcks went down to the
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">point to get some blankets Bill
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">I rin some Bulletts for my revo
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">lver as there is a good deal of ex
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">citement about the Indians
<span style="margin-left: 70px;">of late out at hone y lake &amp; thereabouts.[note]<em>The Plumas Argus</em> of April 29 1858 hinted at brewing tensions at Honey Lake, "For some weeks past the Indians of this country, and particularly at Indian and Honey Lake Valley have been exhibiting an insolent and insubordinate disposition, finding its expression in threats to destroy on an early day the lives of the white inhabitants of the localities mentioned, and in depredations upon the stock and other property in their reach. These threats had attracted the attention of the citizens who were consequently watchful of their movements. It is known that emissaries had visited all the scattered remnants of tribes in this and the surrounding counties, and that, as it were by a common impulse all betook themselves to Honey Lake, carrying with them everything they possessed. We have heard of at least one thousand passing near this place <em>en route</em> for that region.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">At Indian Valley great alarm was created in the minds of the inhabitants, who hastily threw up a Block House near Ward's Ranch. At Honey Lake the belief is universal that there will be a conflict. Already they have driven off a considerable quantity of stock. What adds to the feeling of fear, is that the inhabitants of this boarder region are almost entirely destitute of weapons, the guns belonging to the Plumas Rangers being worthless at the present for the want of caps. The Pitt River and Pi-ute Indians have not been in Honey Lake for some time. When they left it was with the threat to return in a short time for a fight. On all sides a conflict with these savages is universally feared and expected. We understand that the Plumas Rangers will go to Honey Lake to protect the settlers. We sincerely hope that nothing may come of these suspicious appearances, but we fear the contrary.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We can not imagine why these savages are not on the Reservations. Had it not been for the unwise assertion of some of the inhabitants of Honey Lake, that they were in Utah, we have every reason to believe that Genl. Clark would have established a military post at that place, but as his Department only extends to the California line he would do nothing. We hope that he may do so yet, for the objection mentioned should not obtain, as in fact a large portion, if not the whole of Honey Lake Valley is undoubtedly in California."
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">A few days later, <em> <a href="http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=DAC18580513.2.4&amp;e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN-------#" target="_blank">Daily Alta California </a></em>of May 13 1858 provided an update: "One Garlow, who came down yesterday from the Big Meadows, informs us that on Thursday last, the news was brought to Brown's house by a Deputy Sheriff of Plumas county, of a fight which had taken place between a party of residents of Honey Lake and some Mormon emigrants on one side, and a party of Pitt River Indians on the other. It seems that the Mormons, who were on their way from Oregon to Salt Lake, had been robbed of their cattle by Indians, who subsequently offered to exchange he cattle for flour. This proposition was acceded to; but when once the rascally red skins had obtained the possession of the flour, they refused to give up the cattle. Pending the parley that followed this treacherous act, a party from Honey Lake, who were in pursuit of cattle which had been stolen, joined the Mormons, and made battle with the Indians. The fight lasted for two or three hours, and resulted in the death of twenty Indians and the wounding of two whites. The Mormons recovered all their cattle, and the Honey Lake party found more than enough in the possession of the Indians to make up their losses. The conquerors scalped their slaughtered foes and returned in triumph to Honey Lake. Garlow was unable to learn the number of whites and Indians engaged in the conflict or the condition of the wounded men. The Indians, who were of the Pitt river tribe, were all armed with guns. Much apprehension is felt among the residents about Honey Lake Valley, and a general uprising of the Indians is feared. Those who have heretofore lived about the white settlements have all gone away, providing themselves with ammunition before their departure.—Butte Record, May 10th"[/note]</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>
