general think I answer your letters the next day, after getting

was on the eve of leaveing, and we were fixing her off
She is now living in Jefferson ville Indianna across from

church thare, gets a sallerie of one thousan a year,
we received a letter, or I did, from Brother Stafford
yesterday, the members had her carpets all down, furniture
aranged, and dinner all ready when she got thare
and had put lots of groceries thare also for them
she says she is so nicely fixed, but had rather be
with sister Mollie while she is in Ky and thinks it
sad that we will probally never be the old home
together again. we have enjoyed our visit, but yet
Papa being away from us so far, would at times make
Mama gloomie, You speak of not being well, I fear
you &amp; Rob were exposed moveing out driving could
not protect yourselves take good care of yourself
and try doctering some for you complain I hope
comfortable, and our little ones can chase bad
feelings away. I feel that they will need you and
I a number of years yet, ere they will be able to cope with
the world, the reason I wrote as though I would come
home in winter I felt uneasy about scarlet fever,
thare had ben several deaths from it in town, but
at present I believe there is only one or two light cases
in town. I make Morgan play about home, am very
carefull whare he goes, take every precaution to keep
them from taking cold and keep them well, they
are all well now. Birdie is asleep Morgie &amp; Mollie are
at my table amusing themselves with a little box of
paints, but to night how we should like to see Dear

ride in that boat with our turning over. I think
I will take the chidlren and go out to Aunt Lizzie
Moores I did not want to go while Julia was
here, tell Ma I will answer her letter when I
come back from thare, and tell Bob I think
just as much of him as the rest of My Bro &amp; Sisters
but I had to just make him mad a little
to get him to write to me, and I will answer
his letter ere long, tell Bob I dont think him
a bit selfish for I have never forgotten when
a letter Bob like Morgie, he could never eat
any think nice he had, unless he had divided
with us all, but had to scold because he would
not write. Bring 5 little ones here they have to take
truns who shall eat first, and to night they want
me to tell Pa &amp; Granma to have a long table
so they will not have to wait when they come home
Mattie says tell Papa that it will will take a pretty long
table for this teaset. Papa did not give his opinion
about all of his family being murphyites except toots
I heard from my old Lady she expects to come with

I shall start from Brother Staffords as he can
assist in getting my ticket in Louisville. You say
when we come that we can go and see aunt Jane

children, one gets pretty dirty. I will make it my busness

school near for our children Morgie &amp; Mattie are both
