We mounted our mules, putting one of the trunks on a mule and leaving the other three behind, and started for Rabbit Creek. We got along very well. It commenced raining about noon and then snowed the rest of the day. We made Rabbit Creek just before dark, all wet and cold.

<strong>Tuesday 11</strong> - Cleared off in the night and was frosty in the morning. The snow here is 3 1/2 feet deep and is settled down almost enough to bare a man. The sun shone out bright and warm all day. We all stopped for the day.

<strong>Wednesday 12</strong> - Quite clear, with wind from the North. At 10 o’clock I and Dave started for Gibsonville, leaving my wife and Lizzy at the Rabbit Creek House to board at the rate of $14 apiece per week.[note]"When on the way inland from the coast, the Haun party snowed in at Buckeye for three weeks. After the storm was over, the party continued the journey, Mr Haun hauling his mother on a hand sled." (From the records of the Plumas County Museum.)[/note]
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We arrived on foot at Gibsonville at 1:00 P.M. The sun shone warm and pleasant all day.</span>

<strong>Thursday 13</strong> - Cloudy this morning. We had made a pair of snow shoes apiece and, after paying our bill for three meals and lodging each, $6, at the Mountain Cottage, we started for Nelson Point. We got about one mile and had to return. I forgot my revolver, besides we could not keep our snow shoes on. We again started after 10 A.M.  and with much difficulty and tying we got out shoes to stay on. By this time the snow had begun to fall and the wind to blow.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We got to Onion Valley after noon, waited 1 1/2 hours for dinner $2. It was still snowing a little. We tied on our shoes and again started out, the wind blowing a perfect gale. The snow was drifting and light. We arrived at the Point after sunset, quite fatigued and the skin rubbed off our feet in several places, but we went on home.</span>

<strong>Friday 14</strong> - I found all well. John and  Rains and James Shults is boarding with us. The snow is about one foot deep here after setting. The boys have not been able to do any work in the diggins since I’ve been gone on account of water.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">The sun has shone out most of the day, but looks rather stormy. We made a road between the cabins and to the ditch to get water. The boys hauled up some wood. I tool a warm bath last night and slept fine.</span>

<strong>Saturday 15</strong> - Commenced snowing early last night. This morning the new snow was six inches deep. It continued snowing and misting all day. We don’t so much as think of going to work and eat twice a day.

<strong>Sunday 16</strong> - Rains and Shults did not come home last night, but Shults came early this morning and says Bill is drunk. I read six of the last chapters of Paul’s Letter to the Romans. After breakfast I, Dave and John set to work and made four pairs of snowshoes out of  hoops and flour sacks, intending to go after my wife and Lizzy as soon as the weather is favorable.

<strong>Monday 17</strong> - Cloudy and misty all day. We fixed up our snowshoes. In the after noon I, John and Dave went up the ditch to see after the water. It is making its way down 1/2 mile from the reservoir. Our snowshoes is very imperfect from trial made.

<strong>Tuesday 18</strong> - Up two hours before daylight and breakfast over, waiting for day. Cloudy. John started for Quincy to get the clerk’s certificate of release for I. T. Pratt and D. H. Smith, freeing them from continuing my security any longer as guardian for my son John, as he is now of age. The sun shone out all day. I was fixing snow shoes. John got home about sunset with the certificates from the clerk and judge.

<strong>Wednesday 19</strong> - Clouded up last night, with the wind blowing from the South. Its raining and snowing a little today.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I and Rains went up the Pike Ditch to see what had become of the water. The levy was broken in many places, the water running out. We mended it up. There is almost enough water for the pipe head.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We did intend to go over to Rabbit Creek after my wife and Liz today, if the weather would have permitted. It is now bedtime and raining considerably.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">John paid $2 for the clerk’s certificate of release, and $8 to Duesler.</span>

<strong>Thursday 20</strong> - Breakfast is over and consultation has been had. I, John and Dave put on our snowshoes and carried a pair for my wife and a pair for Liz. Also a pair of my best pants for my wife to put on. We took dinner at Gibsonville, $3 for us three, and then on to Rabbit Creek about sunset.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">The day was cloudy at intervals.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I received a letter[note]This letter has been preserved and his available <a title="December 19 1855" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/version-iii-series-ii/december-19-most-likely-1855-martha-haun-to-james-haun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.[/note] from my wife on the road written the day before, stating that she wanted us to come after her.</span>

<strong>Friday 21</strong> - It commenced snowing early last night and kept it up all day.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We went to a dance last night. I gave Dave $1.50.</span>

<strong>Saturday 22</strong> - It snowed all of last night but cleared up this morning. I mailed three letters for $.75. One of them was to D.H. Smith containing a release deed from John as my security as guardian for John. I paid the bill at Rabbit Creek House for 90 meals $62, then filled a carpet sack, flour sack and basket. Off we started on foot—I, John, Dave, my wife, Liz, and a man by named Smith, wading through the snow. My wife gave out at the Mountain Spring House.

<strong>Sunday 23</strong> - Clear, cold and frosty last night. I, my wife and Liz tried to sleep together. It was too cold and the bed was so very hard we slept but little.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">After breakfast was over we dug up a sledge out of the snow. I went and got a young fir tree and made half soles for the runners. Then I tied on our luggage and put my  wife on. I paid the landlord $10 and off we started—four of us to pull and Liz to get along the best she could. As soon as we got in the woods the snow crust broke through. So, Dave went on to Gibsonville after our snowshoes and met us 1 1/2 miles from Gibsonville. We arrived at noon, took dinner, $6, and soon after started for the Onion Valley. But got to the foot of the hill and returned again to the Mountain Cottage.</span>

<strong>Monday 24</strong> - Clear and very cold last night and all of today. After 10 A.M. we paid our bill $12. We set out again with some three men to help us and got half way up the hill, but the wind blew from the North East so cold we was afraid to risk the top, for fear of freezing my wife and Liz. We turned about again and went back to the Mountain Cottage and put up for the day. I and John went out and got some timber to make a new sledge. We succeeded in getting it partially made.

<strong>Tuesday 25</strong> - Christmas morning and cold yet, but moderated somewhat and cloudy. We set to and finished our sledge and harnessed up. We paid our bill, $16, and off we started. We had gone 1/2 mile when 13 men overtook us to help us over the mountain. We hauled them mostly up to it top. Some four returned and the rest went on to Onion Valley. We put up for the night. The men took an hour to eat dinner and then returned to Gibsonville. It was snowing.

<strong>Wednesday 26</strong> - Snowed all night and at this place the wind blew a heavy gale with the snow falling fast. After a late breakfast we hitched up. We paid our bill, gave those that helped us the day before $18 and asked their aid to draw our sledge load through the snow a part of the way. Seven men turned out. When we had gotten over the hardest places three turned back and the other four went on with us to Nelson Point. We arrived all in good order and on time. We put up at the Thompson House. It’s snowing still.
<strong>
Thursday 27</strong> - Rained last night and rained and snowed all of today. So, after dinner, I, my wife and Liz started for our cabins. It was as much as my wife could do to walk home. Dave and John went home yesterday evening and found Shultz and Rains drinking and gambling at the Point. I paid my bill at the Point. John, his ma and Liz got supper.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">On last Monday the 24th several men had their feet frosted considerably passing between Onion Valley and Gibsonville.</span>

<strong>Friday 28 </strong>- I was up before daylight as I got cold in the bunk I was sleeping in. I was not in my old cabin—we had concluded to stop in the other cabin. Liz and John got breakfast. That over, I concluded to move back into my own cabin. I took down the old bunks and put up two double ones, one above the other. I and my wife take the under, and Liz the upper one.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Clear and cold last night and all of today. The women has been cleaning up today.</span>

<strong>Saturday 29</strong> - Clear and cold last night and all of today.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I was fixing up my old cabin—chinking the cracks on the inside with rags and taking down some old shelves. John, Dave and Rains cut a set of cabin logs by noon to make a store and cook house. Dave broke my ax cutting today.</span>

<strong>Sunday 30</strong> - Cold and clear. We all put in our time rather poorly. The cold weather, the lack of comforts for females all tend to make our time drag, heavily on, and it is entirely too cold to do anything at mining.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I read the last two chapters of Fist Corinthians. I wrote a letter to H.P. The days and nights are very cold, and our water ditches are frozen dry.</span>

<strong>Monday 31</strong> - Still cold and clear. John went down to the Point yesterday and got a crosscut saw. Today we sawed blocks and laid the foundation of a new cabin. I had two sledges to mend, as they bear up the log and our selves. The team, my wife and Liz were washing our duds and doing the cooking.
