John Haun,

My dear Cousin,

I have just learned through Ms. Robinson of San Francisco that you are a prisoner at Camp Chase and sick. As your cousin I claim the privilege of ministering to your comfort and  hope you will immediately grant me the privilege of doing so. Please write as soon as you get this and let me know what you need and I will furnish you with great pleasure. You will soon know to send me a familiar. Let me hear from you immediately.

Your Affectionate cousin,

Maggie K Webb
Care of Webb, Cooke and Co.
