<span style="margin-left: 420px;">November the 29th 1853[note]John J. Haun recorded the receipt of this letter on <a title="February 1854" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/version-iii-series-i/february-1854-2/">February 4 1854.</a>[/note]</span></span>

My own Sweet Husband,

I have just sent a letter to the office yesterday morning for John although I have no news to write you—yet I feel like talking to you and feel like encouraging of you to persevere. You know what and how I feel about you as well as I can tell you, for you well know my strong and ardent attachment for you, and at the same time you know my pride and ambition— Sometimes my affection and desire to be with you almost over comes my better judgement—

You need not fear any thing on my account. I am getting along well and with credit to myself, though I miss you—none on this earth knows but myself how much—yet let me say to you never become discouraged but persevere and hope on and I know you will succeed. What is two or three years, if in that time you can come home with means to situate yourself as you would wish?

There was a man this morning in passing my door asked me when I had heard from you— he told me to say to you that a friend of yours had told me to write to you and tell you not to think of coming back until you got plenty. He says you do not think he is your friend and told me not to say who it was, but he says God knows he would like to see you come back with plenty—He has never spoke to me nor any of the members of the church since he left it, until this morning. He asked about you and we then got into a chat. He says he has noticed me and seen how melancholy I looked at times and felt like telling me to be cheerful and to write to you to stay. Yes, he says, he had better stay three years there to have all the troubles and hardships and then come back without making anything-- The man was Jeffry Shepard.

I am a woman—but you must be a man now in this separation. A woman’s feelings will sometimes over come her judgement, but you must not be so. Let your judgement prevail. Oh, how I would dislike for you to come back as poor as you left--and on the other hand how proud I would be for you to come with plenty. So give it a fair trial and do not become discouraged too soon. Oh, it would be the happiest and the proudest day of my life to see you and John get back with money enough to place you where you deserve to be. Then do not, my love, be discouraged nor give way to gloomy forebodings. I know your energy. I know your industry. Keep in good spirits, hope on, hope ever, and know that I suffer as much you, and more in mind than you do, for you have our darling boy with you to cheer and comfort you and to feel an interest for.

I have no one, no, nothing on this earth with me to love. I take an interest in poor little Liz because I look upon her as in a poor situation, for her farther will never do much for her nor any of his children. He is sick now at Mr Moore’s. I have not seen him since he has been sick, nor do I know what is the matter with him. One thing I do know: he will never do much for anyone. The feeling I have for Liz is not like the love I bear my own dear child, and yet for all this I am willing to bear our separation yet longer for your sake and his, that we may all live the happier when we do get together by having plenty to do a little as we please.

Then, let me encourage you not to give up the ship as long as there is any hope—you must know that I have as much to do as I well can do to attend to and manage a helpless and expensive family of Negroes. They are all woman and children but Sam. But I can get along, and now that I have got to keeping house I can do so much better. If I had gone to keeping house last Spring it I could have saved something by it, for Bet could not feed herself and children, let alone paying house rent and clothing for themselves. Sam said he never worked so hard in his life as he did. She worked hard but always was the poorest manager in the world. I can make her make as much as she made by herself and it takes no more now to feed all of us than it did them without me Sam declares it does not take near as much, nor do I believe it does, for I manage it now myself.

The people that has Kit is very much pleased with her. They say they never had a better negro nor would wish a better one. I come so near selling her when I had to take her from Pris White that it has scared her up to do better. I told her I would positively sell her if I had any more trouble with her. I had to keep her at home about three months before I could hire her out, but Pris has had two Negroes since she had Kit and now has none. They both ran away. There is no negro will stay there. She is a mean-principled woman. I expect, from what I hear, that Kit is in the family way again. Mr Moore sees her occasionally at Harriet's and he said the last time he saw her she looked very fat like there might be something of that sort the matter.

I wrote to you in my last that Sam Thompson had moved to town. I have never got any money out of him yet. He told me the other day he would pay me in a few days but I doubt it. I have not been able to collect any money since you left. Bat is trying to do something with Green. He thinks he will get something. Dr Hall says he has paid you and has your receipt I told him to bring in his receipt but he always says he forgets it. He knows he lies about it. I intend to sue him if he does not show it. I have seen some of the meanness of man about money matters, and God knows if I had been a man and learnt this in early life they never would have got much off me. I showed Clint West his account and he said it was all right and said that you and him had some dealings and if I would give the account to Bat he would settle with him. I did so and Bat says he made you even on some of your old gambling scores. I thought of suing him and making him prove it. I consulted with some about it and they said it would only put me to cost, for he would not pay any of his debts and he was law proof, though everyone said I could get a judgement. Tell me if I must sue him or not. I feel very much like I want to expose him. Had it not been the fear of giving something for nothing I would have sued him long ago. I do not know yet but I will. Tell me in your next what you think of it.

Now my darling husband, farewell for this time. Write to me on the receipt of this and write everything. I am always anxious to get a letter and fear almost to open it for fear of bad news. I cry for four or five days always after getting a letter on account of the hard way you have to live-- but if you can only keep  well you need not care for looks or any thing of that sort so you do not actually suffer. When I think of my poor child having to cook his own victuals and wash and mend his own clothes and yourself too, oh God, how I wish I could do it for you and how it makes my very heart ache. I cannot help it, let me try as I may, and I think of everything to make it as light as possible. I know there is plenty of men that has had it to do. My old father has slept on the naked ground many a night, and had to cook and wash for his self and often little or nothing to cook. Little did I think when I used to hear him tell of it that my poor child would ever have it to do so... but if you and him can live through it and accomplish your designs it will never hurt you and you will not regret it. You will have it to think and talk of in your old days.

Now goodbye sweetest. If I could only kiss them precious lips, that chin, forehead and cheeks. I think if I could see you I would not be willing to get out of your arms for a month. Then for my sake take care of your health and never forget your devoted wife,

M. Haun
