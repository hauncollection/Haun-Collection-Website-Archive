<strong>Saturday 5</strong> - Foggy this morning. Bill and Frank broke the handle of the plow. It was mended by noon, and they were plowing again in the P.M. I was raking the trash off the ground for a garden and burning it.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Dave came over this afternoon. I got him to set a log heap afire. Rains set fire to the dead grass where we want to plow and the fence caught fire and burned up some of the rails about dark.</span>

<strong>Sunday 6</strong> - Cloudy and rained some today. John came over today and brought $500 he borrowed of John Ritchy at 3 per cent per month. $61.25 was taken out of the diggins last week. I had to drive out a lot of stock and put up the fence.

I gave Isaac Jennings up his mortgage and paid the county clerk $.50 to write the satisfaction of the same. I paid Cross $4 for blacksmithing, then I and Kayler started on foot for the diggins, my old home. We arrived at noon. After dinner we went out to the diggins, the upper as well as the lower. We walked around till night. It rain all day, and not much gold was got.

<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I and Kyler was all evening looking out a locality for a ditch to carry water from Rocky Bar across the middle fork of the Feather River, rather a difficult job.

<strong>Monday 14</strong> - I went down to the Point. John and Joe at work at the upper diggins and Dave at the lower. I waited for Kyler to come up from the Rocky Bar claims after taking possession. We and Duesler then started for the valley.

<strong>Monday 21</strong> - I slept in my old bunk with John. Breakfast over I, Dave, and Kyler went down to Rocky Bar and took dinner with the Sterlings.

P.M. Sherwin came down and proposed to extend his flume if the miners on the bar would agree to pay him $1,200 when the water was ready for mining, and he would pay two per cent per month until we got in water, and then we were to pledge ourselves to take $1,300 worth of water and lumber to secure him from loss. We went up to Fox’s, supped, and stayed all night.

<strong>Tuesday 22</strong> - We breakfasted and went down to the bar again. We talked with the miners and all concluded to accept Sherwin’s proposition. Dined at Fox’s.

P.M. Closed the bargain. Paid my bill $2.50 to Fox and started for home. Stopped a while at the diggins with John and got home at sunset. All’s well, or nearly so.

<strong>Wednesday 23</strong> - Set a log heap on fire in the barn lot and raked up a lot of trash and burned it. I and Frank was building a plank fence in front of the barn.
