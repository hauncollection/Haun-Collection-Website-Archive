<div style="text-indent: 4em;">    Dear Friend</div>
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">your welcome letter of the</div>
7th was received the evening of the 18th contain
ing one of inquiry from my friend in Penn
you may imagine I was surprised receiving
a letter from that quarter concerning the lost
babe myself. I immediately seated myself
and responded to it also wrote one to my Dear
mother and Father concerning my where abouts
no doubt you will consider me very negligent

[aside]
seeming negligence

for so doing, or still worse that I care but very
little for my parents but such is not the case. I
have been led to believe from time to time I would
soon be released when I could write giving more
fully an account of my “sojourn in Tenn”
likewise that of Camp Chase” Thus the time has
passed to the present. I think Mrs Webb a very
warm friend of mine but she like a great
many others knows but little of the difficulties
that prevents a person from getting a release
from Camp Chase. I have tried almost
every means within my knowledge but as yet
have been unable to gain my liberty on any
terms and I am not alone in this endeavor
as friends are unable to accomplish much at
home. I requested some of my friends to write
to my parents when I left home telling of my
where abouts but it seems they have not comp
lied with their promises or they have been mis
carried Mollie Mrs Webb asked me some very
funny questions regarding your self once upon
a time but I did not commit myself did you
as I thought such questions out of place. I can
certify to you being a truthful young ladie. I
cannot say I did not suffer this cold spell. but
Ive done very well considering the circumstances
It was the coldest weather I ever experienced in
my life but I hope the worst is over for this
winter. Mollie I am very fond of mince pies
particularly when “mam makes em” tell your
ma to preserve me one in vinegar so as it will
keep until I can get it. Just consider my mean
ing regarding George Jackson like everything else
I say a pack of nonsense with no meaning
particularly I am well a ware he never waited on
you I am very sorry for poor Evan Cannon
and for Sallie should she lose her husband
to early in life but such things will happen
Mollie you are a buisiness little wo man aint you
as for taste I always know you possessed that qu
alification to perfect hence the cedars. I flatter
myself I would make some poor girl a good
husband if you consider starving by degrees good
If I do not appreciate you please just show me the lad
that does as brass buttons are valuable here. As for
you not allowing another theft I do not see
how you can prevent it for rogues do not gen
eraly ask permission to steal so I will not
Bear in mind this is leap year and I will
answer all questions required of me, I must
hasten to close, do as I have done by writing soon
