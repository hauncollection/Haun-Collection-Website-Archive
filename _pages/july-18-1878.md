this got of July 1878

My Dear Husband,        I have not had
a letter for some time from any of you
nether have I written. I have not been
in Georgetown for two months or more
I have been going a round a mong the
kin &amp; every body is verry busy harvesting
I did not get to see Moore until I went
to Bryens he came over one evening &amp;
stayed tel bed time. I know it was
at Lizs suggestion he was verry cool
but invited me to see him I did not
go while in that neighborhood. the mo
ing I left Bryans I was him as I
prassed a long the road &amp; told him I wou
ld like to have a talk with him &amp;
asked him to come down to Sally Adams
he told me to come there. so I went &amp; stayed
one week &amp; him &amp; Liz went last Sunday
with me to Eliza Coyls &amp; stayed all day I
did not ask him to go it was there own poor
I can get nothing by law so I
am trying to work the matter the
best way I can. I asked him if he did
not think it nothing but right that
he would give back to me what he
got by him, he said it was not law
&amp; if he did that that all of the brother
&amp; sisters children would be entitled to
it as much as I would be he said he
would see me a gain a bout it so I
do not know whether he will do any thing
or not. I want you to send me money
as quick as possible to go home on shorlo?
I not get any from there Send me a hundred
&amp; fifty dollars in case I do not succeed in
my under taking I sometimes think he [rente?]
try to keep out of my sight but he shod
not do that I stil think I will get some
thing out of him, but it takes time &amp; a
great deal of management I am getting
verry anxious to see you all &amp; get home
but as long as I have any hope of doing any
thing I will not give up. I have so much
to tell you that I am anxious to get home
they have all been verry kind to me but
I have under taken a big job for one
of my age, but I am determined to leave
nothing untried &amp; by the time you
can get the money here I will know
whether I can do any thing or no. I have
been travling a round from one place
to an other visiting the kin until I am
worn out &amp; want rest. Sally Adams
has her horse &amp; Rackaway &amp; takes me
a round a good deal, how are you
all doing do let me know here
you are &amp; how situated. write imme
diately &amp; tell me how Mollie is getting
a long &amp; the prescious little ones
give my love to all &amp; direct your
letters to Georgetown. I remain
your loving wife. M Haun--
