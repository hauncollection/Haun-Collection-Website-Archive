<strong>Tuesday 1</strong> - Lem and Henry went to mowing, Rains cocking up hay,[note]Piling up hay. The term ‘hay cock’ refers to a small conical pile of hay, also known as a hay stack.[/note] and I to fixing the scythes.

P.M. Smith and Dutton came over to work at $65 per month.

<strong>Wednesday 2</strong> - I received $3 for the use of the grindstone. I paid $.75 for 2 scythe stones.

P.M. I went to working a hay rake Rains got of Judkins 60 pounds of wheat chicken feed.

<strong>Thursday 3</strong> - I finished the hay rake and Rains went to raking. The other four went to putting it up. I paid $1 for pie plant.

P.M. I and Henry went to work in the garden.

<strong>Friday 4</strong> - All hands idle. John and Dave came over last evening to see the bull and bear fight came off at 3:00 P.M., in celebration of Independence, delivered this forenoon by Hadus—a piece of mockery according to the times. I gave Lem $10, Henry $5, Smith $5, and $5 I worked in the garden till noon.

P.M. I went and saw the dead bears. The bull was scarcely scratched, except where he was goaded to make him mad, &amp;c. A ball or dance comes off tonight at Judge Ward’s—quite a number of ladies, some from a distance.

<strong>Saturday 5</strong> - All slept till late, and none at work today. I got on a small spree today. Ate nothing all day. I was quite out of humor, and especially with the friends of the vigilance committee at San Francisco.

<strong>Sunday 6</strong> - Cockfighting yesterday, gambling last night, and drinking whiskey is the order of the day. I gave Sam Stinson $150 for a little cow and am to give him $50 more in 30 days —
I received $2 for ranching, &amp;c.

<strong>Monday 7</strong> - Rains is still drunk. All the rest of us are at work. I gave Stark $20 for butter.

<strong>Tuesday 8</strong> - Cutting hay and watering the potatoes.

<strong>Wednesday 9</strong> - I and Tom were running water among the potatoes. The other four are at work haying.

<strong>Thursday 10</strong> - Our work is the same.

<strong>Friday 11</strong> - Still the same —

<strong>Saturday 12</strong> - I and Tom have finished furrowing out to water the potatoes.

<strong>Sunday 13</strong> - My wife, Liz and Bill were soon mounted on their horses to visit the old mountain company diggins. We went down to Rocky Bar. The boys took out over $800 in the week past. They came home in time. The boys were down from Massack, and say they have diggins. I was at home all day.

<strong>Monday 14</strong> - Rains brought some tools &amp;c. over from the cabins yesterday, and went back today after some provisions. The rest were haying and I went to watering the garden. The Sheriff served a process on me—a suit for damages by Terwillegar and company.

<strong>Tuesday 15</strong> - All were haying and I was puttering in the garden. Frost last night and quite cool this evening. I collected $8 for eggs. I received two letters from H.P. yesterday stating there was $500 more paid by Bob Bourne and that him and his family was coming up soon, &amp;c.

<strong>Wednesday 16</strong> - Last night was so cold that my wheat was entirely froze out. The oats is also ruined and the potatoes is partially frost bit. My roasting corn, cucumber vines, and melons – all killed. Some wheat and barley that may do to save —

<strong>Thursday 17</strong> - Still cold of nights. I’ve done given up making any money this year on the ranch. I’ve got done, though, cutting grass. Lem started over to Rocky Bar this afternoon.

<strong>Friday 18</strong> - We commenced this after noon to mow down our frosted wheat to make hay.

<strong>Saturday 19</strong> - We’ve been hauling in hay the past two days. Still cutting down the frosted wheat.

P.M. Cocked up all the grass and wheat straw.

<strong>Sunday 20</strong> - John, Dave and Kyler came over last night from Rocky Bar. Dave gave me $150 and John gave Rains $30. I collected $7.25 for ranching and paid Stinson $46.50 more on the cow. I and Bray employed Hundly to attend to our lawsuits at $400, and Hogan to help—rather heavy. I loaned old Alford $10. Late in the P.M. John and Dave left for Rocky Bar.

<strong>Monday 21</strong> - I employed two more hands. I sold the frost bitten barley as it stood for $50 cash to Duesler and got $10 to cut it down. We are done cutting done the frost bitten wheat to make hay.

P.M. I and Hickman went to Alford’s mill and got 1000 feet of plank at the price of $20 per plank of 20 foot long siding for the barn.

<strong>Tuesday 22</strong> - Rains borrowed Wheeler’s wagon yesterday and paid $4 to have the tire bands cut and set, $2 for tar. Two teams are hauling hay, and two men cutting down Duesler’s barley.

<strong>Wednesday 23</strong> - I got another man to help me put siding on the barn, finished the barley, and then went to cut down the oats for the straw only. The days are warm.

<strong>Thursday 24</strong> - Finished hauling hay out of the first field—41 loads, and 8 loads out of the other. I finished nailing on all my planks and did not get the siding finished. The oats is cut and raked, and one of Terwillegar’s suits answered. I gave $6.25 for 50 pounds flour on Tuesday.

<strong>Friday 25</strong> - I’ve got a very bad cold. I was cradling wheat all evening and two to bind.

<strong>Saturday 26</strong> - I finished cutting the wheat. By noon it was stocked up. In  the P.M. I paid off two men $22 for 5 1/2 days work each. I paid Willman $6.25 for 50 pounds four and answered Terwilegar’s other suit at law.

<strong>Sunday 27</strong> - I collected $10 of Judge Ward and $5 of Louis for ranching a white calf and paid Dutton for 20 1/2 days work, $57.25, paid Heckman $7.50. Kyler came over and said they had bought out Fritz at $1000 cash. Took out last week $430, &amp;c.

<strong>Monday 28</strong> - Stergeon came down from Massack. The water has failed; they can not work. He is hauling hay for me. With two teams working at it we hauled in 9 loads today, 7 on Saturday and 3 on Friday last. I was putting in a floor on the lowest side of the Barn. I’ve a had bad cold.

<strong>Tuesday 29</strong> - Still hauling hay. We sent Wheeler’s wagon home this evening. I am quite unwell from my cold and cannot work.

<strong>Wednesday 30</strong> - I settled up with Smith. He had worked 22 1/2 days—I had to pay him in all $56.25. I sent Sturgeon up to Massack to put things in order. Late P.M. my brother Henry, his wife, and two children, Chas Lindley, his wife, and three children, Mrs. Buckhannon, a nurse and child—12 in all drove up in a four horse stage and two extra horses to spend some days in our valley. I was in bed at the time but got out. A dance came off at the courthouse tonight and all went.

<strong>Thursday 31</strong> - I settled up with Sturgeon and he left. 36 1/2 days work amounting in all to $91.25. The visitors all took their rest. Another dance tonight at the courthouse.
