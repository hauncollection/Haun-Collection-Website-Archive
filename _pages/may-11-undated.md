Saterday Night

geting disgusted with it

Some parties in the city

him very much Well have
you sent for Mollie &amp;
have been thinking it
would be best for you
to have her dispatch
to Emit in caise I would
be out in the city at work
And it would be safer to
have the dispatch to him
for he is rite at the landing
And let me no when you
send for her And I can
go down to Emits Stable
every night or so And finde
out when he gets the dispatch
And then I can meat her
At oaklan it would be
Safer to have her dispatch

plowed eny since I left you
Aught to put in All you can

tight I am going to try painting
for a while And if I cant

And tend his place on
Shares I think I would make
A farmer you have no ider
