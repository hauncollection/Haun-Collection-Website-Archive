Thursday July 21 1864
<div style="text-indent: 4em;">Dear absent Friend</div>
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">I think every time, I take up my pen to write to you</div>
perhaps it will be the last time I will adress a letter to you in Prison
that Providence, will surely favor you on some way that once again
you may enjoy and be restored to those privileges one knows little how to
appreciate untill swept away by misfortune ceasless visits. But may
hope our guiden star shall buoy you on. Never think for a moment or alow
yourself to harber the idea that Mollie can forget former Friends and associated
fun, or change the old for the new, such is not the case. Although she may
not write as often as you might wish, yet it is not because she thinks less of
her friends than others but it is oweing to a natural distance, or anpathy
for writing. I expected you would receive our letters on the same days as
Mrs Webb sent me a little note, written by your ma requesting her to dice
ct and foward on a letter for you, and she not knowing whether or
not you had been removed, sent to me wishnig to know your adress
Your Ma spoke of her distress on your account and her aplication to
their Congressmon in your behalf. I sincerarly hope her indeavors may
be crowned with suckcess. But She advises you to return to Cal__ I
think myself it is very good advice. You would then be away from
the dificulties attending war. But I am selfish enough, not considering
Your own comforts. that you would remain here, and help us share
our troubles. You say of course there are secrets in Your ducks letters and you
will let me see them, if I will promice not to tell Chalk, well I should
like to see them but dislike entering into such an agreement for if
she was to insist Uyou know you usued ot say she was quite an
inquisitive little boddy and the old adage being true, that womans
promises are made to be broken, I might tell. Dora I think is some
what relieved since she has gotten home as Buddie raised up
on the street, shook hands with her and invited her up to see
hiss wife Dora says it seems as if I was blamed on all sides
but she will exhonerate me of all blame. And you, I hade hoped
at least, to claim One Friend who would rather pity than blame
when all the world was to ready to censure. But considering I weigh
121 1/2 lbs I suppose my sholders are broad enough to bear it. You want me
to select you a prety plump sweetheart of that weight Net. I intended
to asertain the weights of the girls, and if there was not any of the
spesified weight, and requirements to give you the originals, as to
the plump pretty and Net part of it I cant say but sufice it
is to say, you would have to be ready to pity when others blame
the last to centure the friend that sticketh closer in adversity
before you could have the origonal for a sweetheart, Not thinking
of course, that perhaps you would not except of her on any terms
But enough of such. Mrs Bell White has lost her little girl
Mary Lue White with scarlet fever, she took it very hard, we have
had a great deal of it amongst the children, Fannies three have
had it, but are well at present or very near E Canon is much
worse quite a large picknick in Dudly Davis woods by the well
twoo weeks ago but did not attend being in the country
the Georgetown boys contemplate giveing one this coming
saturday, expect Saxtons band down, think I shall atteng
We three houses, have quite a lot of company, Grammas Aunt
Price, and ours. Aunt and two cousins from Lexington Cousin
Tom Chalk Unckle Bobs wife, and Daughter, from Daducah
Aunt Ritcherson and two cousins from Wellington Mo ow time to
get lonesome Mat Sannders was up on Saturday and
I thinking he came to see Aunt Tish went down town
and he is as mad as you pelase with me, but if my burden
does not thiken much faster perhaps I can bare it. Tommie L
and Annie Price are in Clark. If you will just learn me
how to comence a letter as pretty as yours is comenced I
will be under lasting obligations to you. And will try and
learn you something in return, if you have not graduated
in every thing, so acomplished, that Mollie in her
humble attempts would fail in all undertakeings
which would be any thing but pleasant to her
you say you donot rember who it was that came near making you lose
your hat if you rember you was standing in the midle of the street at the hotell
and like all the rest, made good use of your hat till a body
would have thought every hat was worn out well I shook hands with
the one who, you now as all the rest, delighted to see, the Legon of
the day. I heard from Fannie Johnson the other day she is well and
hearty, when Fan was here, there was a Gentleman from Lexington
down to see her, and since Fannies has been gone he came to see me.
he came down on last Sunday I am trying my best to cut her
out and she knows it, for I told her I was going to try. She does
not know he was down last Sunday, and You know I like
all Girls am crazy to see her I know you will say I am mean
or a bad Girl Ma McCann came down the sameday I was
at Orford, and came on, out to see me, but could not find
the house Dont you think after coming to Georgetown and
then out there it was two bad not to find me I am
dealing altogether in Lexington beaus at present which doubtless
you will think but if you were to see MC you owuld not wonder
I wish you would come home so I could claim a georgetown
beau I believe they all know me two well. I have something
to tell you which I thought to tell you in this letter but
will wait till I see you, it is some thing that will suprise
you very much I know for it did me perhaps you may hear
it but if you have not, you will sometime soon the men
of Georgetown are geting up a burlesque show of some kind
simelar to one we attended for the benefit of the poor. I
have no news to tell you scarcely, and still I wish to fill
out my sheet of paper, with something to while away your
time for a little while, if it is uninteresting But am
fearful on acount of its length, that it will not be
delivered but as mine are generally short, and far between
they may indulge me some. You shurely have drawing
masters in Camp Chase from the looks of your letter

We have such beautiful moon light nights now I often think
of the pretty night we were sitting in the door after Johnnie
Gabe Eaf and Ellen had left, and the wonderful metior
on that ocasion I always shall believe you were frighten
for you just sat and would not talk to me for five
minites or more you say you are going to come and
see me if now one else. Well now dont get out and
start home with out showing your pretty face in Geo__
I have just been wondering to myself i you do think
of going home I believe it is this month one year ago
that you were made a prisnor. John Lemon is very sick at
Camp Douglas I suppose your health is good as nothing
has been said on the subject lately. You ought to bleech
white as snow in a year leading prison life but perhaps
it is built on the order of the prison at Frankford. I
am sufering with a very sore mouth, dont you feel sorry
for me, it hurts me to talk and you know that goes
hard with me, You would not try any roguery now I
guess for fear of contagion if you were to come home
Mollie Chalk and Mary in one letter, would you not think
of another name, Rube or something else to call a
fellow by, body would imagine you were talking about
a dozen girls just so you think I am worth that
many it is all right.
<div style="text-indent: 4em;">Mary has written now you do the same</div>
the very same or the next day after you get this any how. You
are selfish and wish to keep all, and send all of yours
in return, well I should never be satisfied with a part in
the world I am two much like you are yourself in
that respect all are none dont like divisions of that kind
do you
<div style="text-indent: 4em;">Please write very very soon, from            Mollie C Burns</div>
