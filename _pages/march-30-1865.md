<div style="text-indent: 4em;">My Dear Friend</div>
<div style="text-indent: 6em;">Yours of the 27th has been received and I</div>
immediately hasten to respond. I am very very glad indeed the arrival
of my letter was hailed with pleasure but am sorry to think you were sur
prised to receive it. I cannot see why you should be. I can assure you
there is nothing that afford me more pleasure than to recve a letter written
by your own hands, secondly why is it you came to the determination not to
write to me surely you have some reason for so doing “Is it any fault
of mine if so I think you should let me know &amp; at least allow me the priv
ilege of defending myself if not setting it to rights if possible, I thought I had
waited sufficiently long after your departune for a letter to cause me to think
a little strange, I thought perhaps you did not like to write first or else did not
wish a correspondence with me at all please explain yourself you say
you are too forgiving just as if I had been guilty of some heinous crime
if I have done anything that has met with your displeasure I am perfe
ctly ignorant of it &amp; hope you will forgive me for I have not felt at all
like myself since I have been in Ky this time, you should rather sympathiz
than blame me, you know I have often told you, your possesed a forgiving
disposition a trait of character by no means to be despised but on the contrary
when possesed by a lady causes her to appear more amiable &amp; lovely just
why I admire you so much your sweet disposition, perhaps I had better
refrain or you will think I am trying to flatter you but I can tell you I
am in earnest “never was more so in my life”, I am sure I sent you
all of my love am I not entitled to a small portion of yours I think so
you speak of a mothers love it is true what is there like a mothers love pure
disintersted as it is I imagine none so pure &amp; lasting (mother) there is
a magic in the name I too have experienced &amp; been influenced by the love &amp;
teaching of a kind &amp; devoted other, no one loves like a mother, it has
been truly said when all forsake us she still clings the closer to her child
is willing to look over our faults &amp; foibles, Mollie I think you are slightly
mistaken, I do not remember saying your picture should not hang
in my kitchen. In the first place I do not possess the above named
place, since you twit me about my modesty I will tell you, when I try
to behave myself you will not let me, one fault I think is the ladie in the picture
tries too hard to expose her beautiful charms to the public gaze so upon the
whole think it a little vulgar to adorn the parlour of a modest female
But never the less I admire such things &amp; will never forgive you if you rem
ove it from its present position where I cannot get to see it easily, The frames
think lovely, you shall not trade it off if I can help it &amp; I think I can
Dora says you had choice I told her if there was anything vulgar or smutty
about either of them, your choice would certainly be that one just like
you, the reasons I scratched out some of my letter was it contained a great deal
of love &amp; thought you might not like it so well. It was as follows. I never
knew how much I loved you until your absence do not take a sick spell
over it &amp; take to your bed for I meant just what I said, but you never
would allow me to tell you how much I loved you, but you cannot prevent
me from writing it the reason I requested you to burn my letter was I was
afraid some one might get hold of it &amp; see all of the blunders in it. I know
you would do as you pleased in regard to it any how, as you generally do where in
I am concerned. The reasonI did not put Mr or Miss to your cousins name
was I did not know which it was. Ask your cousin to please excuse me
this time &amp; not to think I do not wish to show her the respect that is due a
lady &amp; I will not be guilty of the like again it is all your fault you
might have written to me how to direct it but you are so contrary
sometimes there is no doing anything with you. If you dont quit
being so contrary I will think you are not so amiable after all neither
shall you go with me to see sister Fannie now you have it you say
I did not even ask you to come home. The reason is just this I tho
ught you were enjoying yourself finely &amp; of course I would not have your enjoy
ment to cease just to gratify me. I would rather see you happy than be inst
ramental in making you unhappy. Mollie does not this look like pur
dis interested love for you what do you think of it. It is reported that
Lizzie Putter &amp; John Elliott are married and off of course. Mollie it does
look like we are destined to be separated. I suppose if it is so decreed it must
be for the best, but I suppose it is natural for man kind to find fault
&amp; murmuer at the dispensation of providence when very often it is for
your own good. Mollie I am making my calculations to leave this part of
the country shortly so if you wish to see me, you had better come
home one of these days. Mollie Hawkins is also married to a yank
Lieut. A young lady asked me the other day why I let you go away &amp; stay
so long I told her you did not belong to me &amp; of course could do nothing
with you. She paid you quite a compliment said you was the
prettiest lady in town but I told her I thought you was anything else
but pretty I believe I have in important news to write you, Dora
says I am the greatest flatterer she ever saw becaus I said she was fine
looking do you think sh does me justice I know you dont Dora has been
quizzing me to find out our secrets says he would like to know whether
we are engaged or not, one minute I tell her we are not &amp; the next we are
says I am so agravating that she cannot understand you &amp; I we wont tell her
any of our secrets, she asked me if you kissed me when we first me this time
&amp; told her yes &amp; more too you embraced me also. says she heard us kiss I denied
it at first but she said it was no use that she had ears as well as other
folks your Pa cames in to see me when I am in the parlour your Ma
condesends to come in some times to see me, I think I am gaining
favor with the old folks a little they used to never come in at all probably
they took me to be what I am a very bashful modest young man. There has
been a negro man speaking to the darkies in town recently urging the
men to take their wives out of the wash tub &amp; let the pretty white ladies
take their places that in the south white ladies are glad to marry negro
soldiers. the consequence is a great many are leaving the town &amp; country
all the time, will Crockets &amp; Mrs Findleys have nearly all gone
also some of Billie Graves. I have not seen Dora for nearly two weeks &amp;
can not tell you any news about home but I suppose she has
written you more than I could tell you. I believe I have given you
all of the news I can think of at present John West &amp; wife are in
George town I suppose to make it their home looks like most every
one that leaves town will come back sooner or later it must be
a very enticing little town, even I could not stay away from it
a great while, will close, Rube write soon &amp; for goodness sake send
me some love when you do write. if I did not ask you to come home
I would like to see you nevertheless, we will not send you your duds
or clean rags eigher we would rather you would come after them, if you
are a bad girl we want to see you some times, as ever your true
friend &amp; lover, please accept of my best love &amp; heart felt wishes for your
welfare

J.J.H.

P.S. I send some stamps not
because I think you cannot get any but it is not always
convenient to walk to the office when you write these are for you
to write to me no excuse good bye Rube until I see you
