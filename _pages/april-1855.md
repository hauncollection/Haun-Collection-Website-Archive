<strong>Sunday 1</strong> - It is raining. We had breakfast early and started into town prepared to go to the mountains, but the Yuba River had risen considerably in the night. It took some half an hour for the ferry men to put us across, in consequence of which we were a few minutes too late for the stage and it still raining some. So H.P. concluded he could not go up. He went back home and I stayed in town. I and Jack walked down to Feather River to see its height. The steamer Queen City[note]The Queen City was operated by the Citizens’ Steam Navigation Company under the command of G.R. Barclay, and ran regularly between San Francisco and Sacramento (Citizens’ Steam Navigation Company advertisement. <em>Marysville Daily Herald</em>, Volume VI, Number 20, 20 September 1855).[/note] came up to Marysville about noon, the largest boat yet.

<strong>Monday 2</strong> - Clear weather now. I and William Rains ate breakfast, 40 cents each. We then went to the opposition stage line office and paid for our stage fare of $7 each, and made the ride to the Buckeye House. So off we set. We ate dinner the Oregon House, $1. Now for a mule ride to the Buckeye, which we made before sunset--quite far. I’m good and drowsy.

<strong>Tuesday 3</strong> - Clear and the ground frozen after breakfast. I paid my bill of $2.50, then, once more on my hard-trotting gray mare, we put off for Gibsonville. We arrived at 11:00 A.M. We had bad traveling on account of the new fallen snow. Now on to Onion Valley. The snow is from 2 1/2 to 10 feet deep. We arrived on foot at 1:00 P.M., ate dinner, $1, and started for home. More deep snow to wade through. We arrived at Nelson Point within two hours by the sun. There I met Lloyd, drunk. After some talk with my friends we went home. As we cannot get in the cabin we went on to the diggins. The boys were about ready to quit work.

<strong>Wednesday 4</strong> - A beautiful morning. After breakfast John, Shaw, and Rains (in my place) went to work. I started for the American Valley as the court of sessions was sitting. I arrived in good time having met several of the vigilance committee, all acquitted of the charge of grand larceny. I ate dinner at Dennings, $1, and spoke to Pat Hunly to attend to my law business. Late in the afternoon I went to Myer’s and stayed all night. Supper, lodging and breakfast, $1.25 —

<strong>Thursday 5</strong> - A fine, frosty morning. I started early for the town of Quincy where I got Hung to look up my law matters and, after having it all put in good shape, ate dinner at Jennings, $1. I saw Brad Stephens who had, on Monday last, stuck a pen knife through his throat. He is getting well again, but somewhat crazy. I then started for home on foot in company with four others. Arrived in good time.

<strong>Friday 6</strong> - A pleasant morning. I went out to the diggins and worked some time, and then went down to the Point to attend to a trial by jury of the right of Frees’ interest in the ditch by Boot. He said he did not ask for it. The sheriff levied an execution on it in favor of me against Freer and Vaughn. I paid the sheriff $6 for services performed against Lloyd in  that suit. Shaw, John, and Rains got gold $169.50.

<strong>Saturday 7</strong> - I dressed for mining this morning  for the first time since Thursday the 22nd of March last. I had to stop at noon to wait for the constable to sell Freers’ interest in the water ditch. The sale came off between 4:00 and 5:00 P.M. I being the highest bidder at $50, it was knocked off to me. John the boys got gold $77.50.

I wrote a letter to H.P. on business and paid $1 to the express; also sent him $60 to pay for a pistol and ten dolls he had loaned me when I was last down there. John paid $1.25 for letters in my absence--one from his ma and one from H.P. I read the 17th chapter of Matthew. John did some washing for us, and we went down to the Point. John paid the constable $50 for the interest that was sold yesterday and got a bill of sale. Lloyd is still drunk. I paid $2 for a shirt for Rains.
