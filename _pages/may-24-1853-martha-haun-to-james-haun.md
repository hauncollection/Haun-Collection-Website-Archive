<span style="margin-left: 470px;">May the 24th 1853[note]James Haun recorded the receipt of this letter in California on July 13 1853. In his <a title="July 1853" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/version-iii-series-i/july-1853/">diary</a>, he expressed joy at receiving it, but complained that his wife had not told him which of his letters she had received, or given him any news of their church at home.[/note]</span>

My Dear Husband,

I had gone to bed but not to sleep. Your image and my dear boy's was haunting my memory so much I could not sleep, which is often the case. I lay and listened to Tom Pullen’s mocking bird sing and thought of your until eleven o’clock, when I found I could not sleep. So, I lit the candle and commenced this letter.

I received your most welcome letter two weeks ago yesterday. I slept none the night I received it, joy and sorrow by turns keeping my mind busy. Oh God, how hard it is to be separated so far, but I do try to bear it the best I can, hoping it is for the best. Sometimes I am cheerful and sometimes sad. There is a fear that sometimes comes over my mind that something may happen, that we will not all meet again, and when I feel that way then I am miserable. Then again I am full of hope and anticipate a happy meeting, but let us try and look on the bright side. If I could only know that you were both well all the time. I sometimes fear that you are sick and have no one to wait on you, or may be suffering for the comforts of life—but I try not to think so, for it makes me so unhappy.

I stopped for the night Thursday night. I went to Lexington yesterday evening and got back this. I.H. Haun and family are well. Mary had twin daughters not long since but they were dead born. I was at Mr Moore’s all last week. Liz thinks her health is better. W.G. Haun has been to New York. He came by and stayed two or three days with me and wanted me to go home with him. He said he had come expressly for me to go with him—but unless I could have stayed all summer it would have been two expensive, and I was afraid to do that on account of the chills, and again I felt like it would not be right for me to leave the Negroes-- some of the children might get sick and no one to see to them.

Lizzie Garth and Steve Burbridge was married last Thursday. They had the biggest sort of a wedding.

I have not been able to collect any money since you left. I gave Bat some notes to collect but his wife’s health has been so bad he could not leave her. She is better and he will go next week. He was elected constable a few weeks since. Dickerson says he thinks it is a bad chance to get anything where he is concerned with notes.

I get along very well here. Pratt and his wife are very kind to me. I have no reason to complain of anything, but I do get very restless sometimes, and think if I was keeping house I would feel better satisfied to have the little negroes with me, though they are doing very well. Sam and Bet are industrious and try to do the best they can. So far they deserve a great deal of credit. They show that they have a good principle and are not eye servants.[note]One who only attends to duty when watched.[/note] Bet’s baby is the finest boy she has ever had. Kit and her child is doing well. I have not been able to hire out Wash yet to advantage. I am trying to hire him in Lexington to a tavern. I not know whether I will succeed or no.

I have kept Lizzie with me and am sending her to school to Mr Hard for one session. It will be out in June. Then I do not know what is to be done with her. I have written and sister Lizzie has written but we get no answer. Poor child, I do not know what is to become of her. It seems like killing her to part her from me, and if I go to California I shall take her with me—

Brother James told me that he saw Miss Barton that come right from his neighborhood a few weeks since and by hard begging he got her to tell him about John. She would not say anything until he pursued her a long time. She then said he had the worst sore eyes she ever saw and had the chills and in fact was doing no good. His health was very bad and he was doing very badly with all. I expect to hear of his death. In fact, I had rather hear of his death than to hear what I have. I have kept it all from the poor child. She often asks and wonders why he don’t get a letter from her pa but I put her off somehow. She has written so often and got no answer.

Lizzie is growing and improving as fast as any child you ever saw. The school had a picnic party last Friday and she had to make a speech and crown the queen. She was more praised for the way she performed them anything you ever saw. In fact she is very much admired and praised for her smartness. Ladies have told me that Mr Hard says she is the smartest scholar he has in school. When I look at her  and think she must be kept back on account of means to give her a chance it makes me sorry, for if she had a chance she would do well for herself. If I had anything in my power I would never give her to anyone until she marries. I never will if I can possibly avoid it. As soon as the school is out we will go to the country and stay until fall or winter.

I got a letter from Minerva Foot today. She is not married yet. Everything is moving along about as it was when you left. Eli and Tom Holtzclaw was taken up in Missouri last week and taken back to Madison, Indiana and lodged in jail to wait their trial in September next. They was taken back in irons. There is no chance for to get bail. The family is greatly distressed about them, the poor old people is truly to be pitied.

My own dear husband, take care of your health and of my dear boy. If it was not for the hope of seeing you again I could not live. Oh this world is a perfect blank without you. Write to me often and give my love to all of them, and, oh, my precious child, tell him not to forget me, but not to be melancholy. Farewell, farewell my dear husband. Let us get together again soon as we can somewhere.

Your devoted wife,

Martha Haun
