<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Duesler went home and I went to my old mountain cabins, all deserted and gone. I went in all the cabins but no one to be seen, the fires gone out. O, think what one week has done for this once happy group of inmates, if it was but for a short time.
I picked up my bible and read the 10th, 11th and 12th Chapters of Matthew.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I was till in hopes of someone coming home before dark, but no one is here save me.</span>
