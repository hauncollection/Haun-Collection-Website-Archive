Dear Friend,

No I doubt you will think I have forsaken an old friend (yourself) on account of seeming negligence in not writing—but such is not the case I assure you. I promised to give you a description of the Paris[note]Consult the <a title="Map" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/map/">map</a> for precise location.[/note] fair on my return. Well it was very well attended and about as interesting as ever to those that enjoy a crowd, but I am not one of that number. I stayed in Paris the week of the fair, and attended one of the hops. I also went to see a troop of Louave performers at the Odd Fellows hall and had a good time generally. We then went six miles beyond to a Mr Hildreth’s where I remained two weeks. Mrs Hopkins is keeping house for him. He is quite an old man, and all his children are married, excepting one son, Dick Hildreth. He is 27 years of age and full of fun. He and I would go horseback riding every evening. We went to North Middletown, nearly to Mount Sterling[note]Consult the <a title="Map" href="http://www.hauncollection.org/version-3/map/">map</a> for precise location.[/note] we were going all the time. I never enjoyed myself better in my life.

But I suppose you would like to hear some of the news at home. Well, Mr Sam Long and Mollie Beatty marry tomorrow evening. Mr Wells, the youngest, but largest one in the store that occupies the space where Johnnie Johnson kept his store and Miss Emma Smarr marry tomorrow at noon and then come in to attend the wedding in the evening. I believe the Mr Wells came here after you left. It is rumored Tom Crockett, a brother of Mattie’s, and Tillie Price are to be married but I do not know if it is so. And the Old Man and the widow Pain, also Hat’s old sweetheart. I passed Hat on the street yesterday but did not speak.

Johnnie Fitzsimmons the Irishman, took arsenic and died from the affects of it. He is to be buried this evening. They live opposite us. He told Pa when dying that his fortune had driven him to it. It is said, his mother and father in law and wife abused him sadly.
While I was visiting out at Cane Ridge there was a Mr Frank Colcord who came to see me often, he used to go here, to the Military institute, and said he knew you very well. He is quite a bachelor—you know I am partial to them. It is the same Mat Sanders that married Gabbie Ross. Howard Graves’ body was put in the vault on Saturday last. Mr Blackburn and Charlie are going to Monticello the last of this week after the body of Wallace. They will both be buried together. Oh it makes me feel so sad to see the boys brought home in that way.

I hope you have good health take good care of yourself, for Mollie wants to see you again. You say you get the blues. I wish it was in my power to be near you when you get them, to talk you out of them. I am sitting in our little front room by a good warm fire writing to you where we, in other days, used to have so many pleasant chats. I wish you were here tonight, for I get lonely too sometimes and I know you would enjoy yourself much better than up there in that cold prison.

You ask for a bid to my wedding. Now you just wait till I have a wedding—which I fear will be some time to come yet.

Tommie L. as well as myself know Mr Grimes very well. Tommie and him write to each other. Mr Bat Johnson lost a little child on Saturday last.

You say you are out of employment, and suggest that I employ you as a private secretary to do my writing. I take you at your word: come on, for I have written two today and have got to write another, and my hand is cramped already—but it shall be straight in time for my ring. I have never taken the black one you made off since you put it on last fall with a wish—but I expect you have forgotten the wish. I believe if you were to come home I would be so glad to see you that I would freely give you what you stole when you left. I suppose you remember. I received a letter from Eph but have not answered it, for I had rather do anything on earth than write, so them that I do write to must know that I think a great deal of them. I close requesting you to answer this as soon as received.

Yours in haste,

Mollie Burns
