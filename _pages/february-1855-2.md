<strong>Thursday 1</strong> - Shaw, Lawrance and I went to Sterling's old diggings to look at them. Tried several pans of dirt but got nothing of consequence. I came back and made a pick handle. Pa and I went to the reservoir in the evening to see about the water and went by the diggings and turned it out of the hose. Commenced raining after supper but didn’t continue long. Nothing more today, I believe.
