Mr J.J. Haun,

Dear Sir,

Your letter to me, written at Louisville dated the 11th instance, has been forwarded to me at this place where I am now living, and only reached me two days ago. I was very glad to learn your whereabouts in order that you may get the money I hold for you from your mother.

I could not get a draft for gold here, so I send you an equivalent in currency for the ten dollars in gold which I hold for you. You will therefor please find enclosed a draft for fourteen dollars payable to your order which will I hope be satisfactory.

Please write after getting this as I shall be anxious to know if the draft goes safely. With best wishes for your success and happiness.

Yours Sincerely,

Maggie K. Webb

Direct your letter to
Walnut Hills
Hamilton Co., Ohio
