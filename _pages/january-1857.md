<strong>Thursday 1</strong> - Not so cold, but snowing day and night. Rains started for Marysville and John went with him over to Nelson Creek. Nothing doing.

<strong>Friday 2</strong> - Still snowing and the wind blowing heavy from the roaring up in the mountains. Rains left for Onion Valley. He was till night getting there.

<strong>Saturday 3</strong> - Snowing all the time. John came over today and brought his fiddle and a bundle of clothes. Heavy wading.

<strong>Sunday 4</strong> - Snowing as usual, about 3 feet deep in the valley and quite solid. Got wood and feed.

<strong>Monday 5</strong> - Snowing as usual. All hands are preparing to go to a dance at the Spanish Ranch. Liz went with J. Bass.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">John and Firman went on a jumper with the black horse. I gave John $10.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Mr. and Mrs. Edwards is with us tonight. Tro. Ward went to the dance. I and Edwards went to the dance to prevent Ward from having anything to say to Lizzy.</span>

<strong>Tuesday 6</strong> - We stayed all night at the Spanish Ranch. It cost me $3. After breakfast I had Liz go home; Bass took her. I and Edwards also went along. John and Firman came also. Tonight has been cloudy at intervals —

<strong>Wednesday 7</strong> - Rains has been snowbound at Onion Valley. It snowed very hard last night for a while. I sent a load of hay to Dr. Kate at Betsy Town on a sledge. The sun shone out at intervals.

<strong>Thursday 8</strong> - Very cold last night. We had quite a time to get wood to make fire. Did nothing but feed our stock —

<strong>Friday 9</strong> - We all went out slay riding with John Thompson down to Dan Cates’ on Wednesday night. Came back about midnight —
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Clear of nights, and very cold. The house was booming this morning when I awoke from cold. The sun shone out but dimly. Later my wife went a-slay riding with Madden, Mrs. Edwards, and Liz, with John Thompson. They all went to the Illinois Ranch and came back home again tonight.</span>

<strong>Saturday 10</strong> - Snowing, the weather somewhat moderated. We do not pretend to work any.

<strong>Sunday 11</strong> - Commenced to rain and has been raining all day. We hauled a load of hay to Steve Bass, say 1,400 pounds.

<strong>Monday 12</strong> - Raining last night and today, and bids fair to continue on.

<strong>Tuesday 13</strong> - Rained last night and today. I sent a load of hay up to Betsy Town to Howard yesterday at $40, to be paid on the 1st of April.

<strong>Wednesday 14</strong> - Rained last night and today. John and Moore cut and hauled up some logs for wood.

<strong>Thursday 15</strong> - Still raining night and day. Mr. and Mrs. Edwards came to stay with us all night —

<strong>Friday 16</strong> - Snowed last night several inches and raining today. Late tonight Dr. Cate took Edwards and my wife home with him in a slay, &amp;c —

<strong>Saturday 17</strong> - Raining as usual last night and today. We hauled a load of hay for Maston to D.J. Willmans.

<strong>Sunday 18</strong> - Rained last night and today but the sun shone out at intervals. Our town is quite dull, as the American Ranch hotel has been closed a full week. Also the Bass saloon since Monday last. Most all the loafers has left Quincy.

<strong>Monday 19</strong> - Clear and warm today. I John and Moore cleared off the snow near the barn and built a cow rack. John and Moore went out and got a stick to make a pair of sledge runners and hauled it in —

<strong>Tuesday 20</strong> - Frosty and clear last night, but foggy this morning and warm and pleasant today. John and Moore took a yoke of cattle and hauled the stick of timber down to Boyington's mill and had it sawed into runners and hauled home.

<strong>Wednesday 21</strong> - Clear and frosty last night but warm and pleasant of days. The snow is melted off the low hills on the North side of the valley. We all three went to work to make an ox sledge, after the sun got up to melt away the frost —

<strong>Thursday 22</strong> - Still frosty of nights. We were again at work at our sledge and finished it long before night. The snow is sinking down very fast and freezes very hard so that one can walk on the top of it and not break through.

<strong>Friday 23</strong> - Still clear and cool of nights and warm of days. John and Moore went out to the woods and cut some dry spruce for wood. I sold some potatoes $3.50 and collected $10 of Potts last Monday. I paid $.25 for a letter to Lizzie and $.25 for a letter to wife from Georgetown Kentucky written by Ann E West[note]Not included in this collection.[/note], and all's well.

<strong>Saturday 24</strong> - Clear and cool last night and warm today. We yoked up the cattle and went to the wood with our new sledge and hauled a load of wood to the shoe maker and one to our house, and a load of rails also. There has been several women delivered of children very recently—Mrs. Bass, Vaughn, Hundly, Lewis, and an Irish woman all in our little midst, and no thanks to anybody outside. Several others not log since, and still more to come. This is a great country for children, and healthy ones at that.

<strong>Sunday 25</strong> - Clear as usual last night and the sun is shining out bright and warm this morning. F. Fox stayed with us last night. John and him is going over to Nelson Creek. John is to work at Rocky Bar. I sold $4 worth of potatoes. Cloudy in the P.M. and the wind blowing gently as if to rain.

<strong>Monday 26</strong> - Clear last night, but not cold. Somewhat cloudy today. Moore hauled a load of wood on the sledge. I cut and split some wood for the cook stove.

P.M. Moore was separating the frozen potatoes from the sound ones.

<strong>Tuesday 27</strong> - The weather is quite moderate both day and night. Moore rode the black horse to see Havlan’s mining clams and ditch. I was sorting potatoes all day and sold 50 pounds potatoes to cooks.

<strong>Wednesday 28</strong> - Still pleasant and cloudy with a little rain. I finished sorting potatoes.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">A trial was had in Quincy today for fighting on Sunday last between Robinson and Slacum. The parties were acquitted, and the cost upon the county. Cooks paid me $8 for potatoes. Robinson was hit a few blows in the face by Murray tonight. It was all right—he needed it.</span>

<strong>Thursday 29</strong> - Warm and pleasant. Moore is cutting rail timber. I bought a county scrip[note]A substitute for money, for example a token, voucher, or chit.[/note] of Hall to pay taxed $6.50 with $5.50.

<strong>Friday 30</strong> - Moore broke his axe and had it set up again. I helped him grind it. He went out to cut rail timber. I am not at work—I’ve plenty to do, but don’t know where to begin.

<strong>Saturday 31</strong> - The nights are frosty and days very pleasant. My time was spent in idleness. Mr. and Mrs. Presby and Mrs. Stinson took dinner with us. Moore is cutting rail timber. Cooks got 100 pounds potatoes last night.
