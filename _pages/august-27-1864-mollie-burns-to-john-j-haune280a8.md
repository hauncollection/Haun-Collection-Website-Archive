Dearest Friend,

Dating my letter calls to mind that another summer has come and almost gone. Winter with her chilling blasts is almost upon us and you are still an exile and a prisoner from your home. But talking of, or thinking about, this does not mend the matter in the least, or many a prisoner ere this would have been released from locks and bars.

You it seems adjusted your guessing cap, rather than the studying one, but you will have to make a better guess than that before you can come anywhere near it. You must try again before I till you. I am glad to hear that my long letter contributed somewhat to your happiness. It is a pleasure to me to add to the pleasure of my friends. If you will exonerate me from all appearance of flattery I promise to do better in the future, and you know Ruby well enough to know, when she makes a promise, it is not a mere matter of moonshine.

You ask if I will not allow you to joke me about my badness, that you go according to contraries, please take it that way. Well interpreting the bad as good, the sour as sweet, there is a rather pleasing closing to your letter. But running my eye over it again, where you say the original will suit better than any other, that she is, you know, plump pretty, and very neat with all. Shall I think my friend means the reverse of all this? If so just let me know a little by degrees—it will be easier to bear. I wait your explanation.

I have some little news. Mr Noah Spears and Chap Steaffee are married, and are on a bridal trip to the falls. My old sweetheart Tom Cocks has been here. I had quite a chat with him at the drugstore. Tillie Price and Grit Weeks are inseparable. Mr Crocket broke the match up between his son and her. Harve Tailor is dead. His wife received a letter from his Captain, he fell on the battle field at Atlanta. Mrs John Wright is also dead. I do not know the particulars of his death. Mary Nickles was buried on Sunday week last. Her’s was indeed a happy death bed. She was so willing to go, and talked so beautifully to those standing around although many tears were shed all knowing
