Billie. Tell him he did not act fairly with
me to take my sweetheart in my absence, dont
you think so. speaking of correspondents. I am
determined you shall not get ahead of me in that
line. I am corresponding with a young ladie
in this state near Cumberland Ohio miss Nannie
McClelland, received a ltter from her yesterday, telling

lining.” I thought of your remark about Billie

of it soon, I never knew how to appreciate liberty
when I had it not until now. Dora must be
paying a visit some place when at give her my
