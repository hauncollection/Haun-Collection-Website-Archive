My Dear Son,

I received your letter of date 29 May this morning and also one from Dave dated the 2nd of June. You cannot form any idea the pleasure it gave me to hear of your good health and seeming good spirits. I am truly sorry to hear of Dave’s bad health but hope he will soon get well...

I am at a loss to know from your pa’s letter whether he is satisfied or no, and you do not say whether you are making anything or no, or whether your uncle H.P. and Cath is kind to you and your Pa. Do not, my son, hesitate to tell me everything, for you little know the anxiety of mind I have about you. I would be willing to go any where on earth to be with you. I want to go out there and help you to make enough to buy us a place where we can all be together. Sam is very anxious to go and I think I could go and take him and we could all of us soon make enough to get us a home where we want to. Consult your Pa about this and write me immediately, and if he is willing we will start the last of October or first of November. I know I can stand the trip.

Bled Harman and Louis West got back last night from Texas. Bled says he will move out this Fall. Louis says he will send his children but will not go himself. They were at Mark Hournoy’s and say that he is doing well and well satisfied. They say he can sell his place for twelve thousand dollars more than he gave. They were at old John Emison’s also.

I wrote to your Pa three weeks ago to day and informed him of the death of your uncle James Hurst. He died the 22nd of June. The balance of the relations are all well. Lizzie is at Mr Moore’s at this time. The Negroes are all well and doing well. The town is about as it was when you left; no material changes except the weddings that I have told you of. Betty Holtzclaw stayed with me last night. I told her what you said and she says she is going to write to you. She says, “yes, indeed she is a going to stick to her promise.” Tell Dave Helen was to see me yesterday evening and I delivered his message. He knows how modest she is and of course he would not expect a reply--

Oh, I had liked to have forgot to tell you that Dick West’s wife has a fine son and Bet Moorland soon will have something. Mr Hunt and wife and children and Cass Blackburn all took dinner here yesterday and stayed a few hours on their way to the blue lake that is a fashionable place this summer. Tom Otherwell will go south this Fall. He says he gave sixteen dollars per acre for his land and it is on the  river and first rate land. I know if your Pa and you would go there or Texas it would not take a great deal of money to get us a good home. I want you to tell me how long you expect to stay out there and tell me what you are doing and how much you are making, you and your pa both. Tell me how your pa is satisfied and how you do about clothes.

Johnny Johnson is in town. He asked me about you the other day and told me to give his respects to you. He says he is very anxious to go out there but his mother is not willing. Ben Chambers has come back from Texas. He says he cannot get any more for his labor there than he can here. The fact is he does not want to labor anywhere. I think that is the secret of the matter. Will Wood is waiting on Mary as usual. People think they ought to marry. Burt Johnson and Ben was on a big spree a night or two ago. They wanted to bet which was the drunkest. Burt does nothing else hardly but spree. He comes in town every evening and carouses all night and leaves at daylight in the morning. He sleeps all day and is ready again for night. He has quit the church long since and I think going to ruin as fast as possible. Dave Sullivan stays out home with him nearly all the time and gets drunk with him in town. Dave fell out of one of the window up stairs here two weeks since and has not got over it yet. He was drunk and got up and went to the window to vomit and pitched out head foremost on the pavement just below the bar room. He cut and bruised his head and face up. It was all the hurt he got but he will doctor him self up so it will not spoil his beauty, so they said. Miss Helen Loffton is in town and I think Burt will or is making a desperate effort to renew his old courtship and trying his best to break off from Betty H. He told me positively that he never intended to marry Bet, but she has told me they would marry, so I do not know how it is, I believe now he is trying to get clear of her, but I do not believe she will let him. I know she will not if she can help it, but I think he is off when he talked to me about her the way he did. I advised him to marry her or quit going to see her so often and he is trying to quit. Certainly she has let him be too familiar--and not only him, but any one else-----

This was court day here today and I have never seen so many people in town in my life. There is so much excitement about the election. There was ten thousand dollars bid today here. There was a company of whigs some from Lexington with lots of money to bet with. Every democrat that would bet and they got bets to the amount I named. Lue Flournoy and Wallace Keene bet largely. There has not been so much excitement here for many years about an election. they say there is more money bet

[illegible] was in Kentucky on an election a great
[illegible] whigs will vote for Breckinridge,[note]John C. Breckinridge, U.S. senator from the state of Kentucky and Vice President to James Buchanan.[/note] Hench
[illegible] and the Barlows that I know of will vote for Breckinridge and you know they are all whigs.

My dear son, I must stop for I have nearly filled my sheet, and, oh, my darling boy, do not forget to love your mother and write me often and tell me everything, for it is all the pleasure I have. All I can take any interest or pleasure in is you and your dear farther and, oh, do not deprive me of that by not writing to me. Give my love to your pa and tell him that it is the hope of meeting again alone that keeps me up. Oh, God, what would I want to live in the world for without you? I would not want to live in the world, for without you again, for it is a lonely life without your pa and you. Anyhow, give my love to Dave, Jack and all of them. Tell Dave I will write to him soon. So farewell my darling boy.

Your mother,

M. Haun
