He was somewhat behind when we three got to the old Terwilliger's diggins. He stopped us by asking what it was that we wanted to have a lawsuit about, and said we had acted damned rascally in turning the water out of our own ditch. This he repeated a second time.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I stepped up to him and said I was one of the company and he must not say so. He repeated it again. I told him he was a liar. He struck me with a shovel. His son and Larison tried to do the same, Dave fought the old man. I ran Larison with a dirk knife and was trying to stab the old man and Fox caught me. Dave was on him, and whipped him badly. The fuss over, we started again for home.</span><span style="margin-left: 28px;">
