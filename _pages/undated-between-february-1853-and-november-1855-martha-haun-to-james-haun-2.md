Though undated, this partial letter must have been written after John's 19th birthday in December 1853 and before Dave's return to Kentucky in March 1854.</em></p>
...but notwithstanding all this I would not have you come home until you are are convinced  you can do nothing there, for you, I know, have under gone so many privations and hardships, that I want you now to stay until you make something. If you want me or think it would be  best for me to go all you have to do is say so. You know I have ever been willing to do whatever you thought was for the best.

My precious child advised me in his last letter to stay where I was. Oh, how my heart ached to read that dear letter and hear a boy of nineteen reason and talk like a man of forty that had gone through trials and difficulties. Oh how proud I feel of him, and yet how sorry to know in his tender years he must be deprived of society and all the endearments of home. I do hope it will not crush his spirits but he a profit to him in the end. Oh, Pa, be kind and tender to him for my sake as well as his own, for we have as much reason to love and be proud of our child as anyone I ever saw.

John says you have just got in to the ways of the country, that you were very green at first, which I expected you would be. You must write to me often and whenever you start home. Come the quickest way and do not think of coming by land[note]The overland rout to California was slower and considered more dangerous than traveling by sea from New York or New Orleans.[/note]—though you are the best judge of that.

I send you a ticket gotten up as a burlesque on the trustees—do tell me in your next how Dave is and what he is doing, and Jack how he is. As for H.P. I care nothing about, for I think he is as ungrateful a being as ever God made. I do not want John to be about him, or be in his power any way whatever–

I wish I could send you a kiss but I cannot. Write me what your prospects are and all about your precious self in every way–I would not take any amount for your letters. I preserve them carefully.

Jane is in Lexington. She told me to give her very best love to you and John. Tell my baby to write to me. I am determined to write every week from this time on and maybe you will get some of them. I must say goodbye for the present—while I remain your loving wife,

Martha Haun

P.S. Jeff Polk is married to Julia Herndon. Lizzie sends a letter to John with this.
