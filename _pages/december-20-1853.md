<p style="padding-left: 240px;">Georgetown Dec the 20 1853</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My Dear Husband--</p>
I received your most welcome
letter of date oct 28th it was seven weeks coming oh how
delighted I was to hear you was doing so well &amp; more than
that you were living tolerably comfortably you can form
some idea of the effect the news had in town when I told
them you was making. I could see so plain a spirit of energy, though
none but said they were glad-- Oh you have no idea how much
good it done me to tell you was making money. it seems to naturel
to the human family not to want other to get a long better
than them selves-- oh it would be the happiest &amp; proudest
day of my life to see you &amp; John land in Georgetown with plenty
of money-- then perserver never give up &amp; I know you will
succeed-- what is the reason you do not get my letters
I know I get all of yours-- I wrote every two weeks &amp; write
you ever think I can, there is five or six letters you have not
got or had not when you wrote this last one-- I am well
but have fallen of in flesh twenty five or thirty pounds- I told
you &amp; John in several of my last letters a bout my going to
house keeping. I told  you all a bout it I discoverd it would
not do at all to let the negroes do as we started out to. I find it
is so much better for my happiness &amp; interest to take care of them
my self-- Kit will have another baby this spring
her other child will not be more than fifteen months
old when she has an other. she is hired out until christmas
to Herriat &amp; they are more pleased with her than any negro
they ever had. Herriot told me himself that he had rather
have her than any servant he ever had a bout him
but says with two babys she could do verry little
&amp; he had rather pay fifty dollars for one with out encumbrance
so you see it is a hard matter to hire out breeding woman &amp;  get
any thing for them but I know they are making more by raising
children than they could do any other way if bet &amp; Kit keeps on the
way they are doing they will make a hansome little fortune themselves
but the difficulty now is to take care of them &amp; get a long so as to
raise them-- I would be glad if you would send me some
money if you have got it plenty- after I get a store I can get
a long os much better than we did before but going to keeping
house has taken more money just at the time but will not
take so much after as boarding you may rest asured I do
the verry best I can-- so give your self no uneasing a bout
me but take care of your self &amp; do the best you can &amp;
make baste to make enough money &amp; come back home---
this will be given you by Emma Smith she gets married
to morrow morning &amp; starts to calafornia she marries the man
she told you a bout his name is Bingo they are going to
San francisco he came in expressly for her he has not been here
more than two months- they have been so anxious for me to go
out with them the poor old man Smith has been to see me
every four or five days a bout it. I read him your letter
before this last what you said a bout my going &amp; he said I ought
not to go unless you wrote for me he heard I got a letter from
you the other day &amp; he came down yesterday &amp; would have me
read it to him-- he told me to give you his verry best love
&amp; respects-- you must go to see Emma &amp; she can tell you
more than I can possibly write-- the church is getting a long a bout
as it were when you left-- I wrote you a letter three weeks
a go on Jef Shepards account he told me what to say to
you for him. I hope you will get it if you do not let me
know in your next. I also wrote you one of three or two
sheets of paper I have forgotten which in which I told
you every thing that would interst you- Ihope you will
get that also let me know &amp; I have written several to
John-- Jane Graves is in Lexington with all of her shil
dren to spend the winter she has been to see me &amp; will
stay with me a part of her tim she looks thin and delicate
she kissed yours &amp; Johns minature a hundred times &amp; tryed
to cheer me up she says she knows it is the best thing you
could have done-- I got a letter this morning from
Jake Winter he tells me his farther has joined the bap
tist church he says he thinks &amp; hopes the old man is
not mistaken I wrote you all a bout old Uncle Sol
omans death Henry has come to live with Aunt
Mary--- I know I got all of your letters &amp; do not
know why you do not get mine I still hope you will
I wrote a long letter to Dave &amp; have now got an
answer I do not know whether he ever got it---
give my best love to Dave &amp; tell him he had better
go to work in the mines with you &amp; Tom &amp; get
money enough &amp; come back with you &amp; let us all
live confortably to gather once more: oh how happy
we could be all of us to gather with plenty of money
you must be sure to go &amp; see Emma more particular
by if you do not get all my letters She will tell you
every thing though she said she would not tell you
a word if I didnot go she only said that when she
was begging me to go--- my prescious boy take
care of my Jewel &amp; loving him safe back to me Pa
&amp; your prescious self with him... I will try &amp; [illegible]
the seperation believing it is for your good--
keep in good spirits &amp; posevre &amp; I know you will succeed

I wish you could see this last boy of bite he is an un
common child he is so big &amp; strong &amp; lively he is not quite
nine months old &amp; he can Spring up &amp; walk a round
a chair as quick as if he was two years old. I tell he she
gite better every one she has &amp; that she is fet for nothing
else but to have boys-- lizzie ran in just now &amp; told me
to go to the door &amp; listen to them shouting over at the methodist church
