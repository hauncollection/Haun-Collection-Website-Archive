<span style="margin-left: 480px;">April 10, 1854</span></span>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My Dear Husband,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I sit down tonight to write you, though with very little hope you will ever get it—but I am resolved to write you every mail any how, which is the first and fifteenth, and if you do not get a letter every mail you will rest assured it is the fault of the mail and not mine, for I do assure you it affords me more pleasure than anything else in this world to converse with you in this, the only way I have to do it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I saw your letter to D.H. Smith. He left it with me a few days and then come and got it to answer it. He said he was a-going to write you a long letter. I have received all of the letters you have written since you left home. I have tonight looked over them all and, oh, how much I prize them, you little know. I have received seven written since you landed<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in California, the last one dated February the 6th.[note]Not included in this collection.[/note]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I got it just one week ago today. I </span>wrote you by the last mail which was the first of this month. My letter was written the 25th of March[note]Not included in this collection.[/note] <span style="line-height: 1.5;">to give it time to get to New York by the time the vessels leave. In my last I told you about</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[torn]</span></p>
think Dave was sadly disappointed in H.P. He found that he was for self altogether, and he being sick all the time, thought he had better hunt other friends. H.P is an unprincipled dog and ever was, and I do hope my child will treat him with disrespect and utter contempt on his parents account, for I do most cordially hate him and ever shall. Tell my child to nurse and encourage his proud spirit for that will greatly help to take him through this world, and tell and not to think because he is working hard and living rough that it is in the least degrading or humbling to his pride. To the contrary it is elevating and ennobling to his character. It should make him feel greatly his superiority to others who are in poverty and have not the moral courage and pride enough to try to get out of it. This is the light in which all persons of worth view these things. Then feel your superiority to a poor indolent low spirited class that have not moral courage enough to make an effort to keep from being underlings. I am truly proud of my boy, for hard as I know his lot must be, I believe with his native pride he is happier the way he is doing than he would be here in idleness and without the means of doing anything he wants to. Tell my boy not to forget me or to suffer his affections to become recede from me by his absence, for he is the pride and delight of my heart and to ever know that he was indifferent to me would break my heart. I pray God that he will prosper you both in your laudable enterprise and that you may soon get to me again where we can spend the balance of our days together in happiness and content, for your and I have not a great while longer to combat the world.
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I think you will come home next winter, at any rate. I hope you will make enough this summer to do you some good to come home with. I shall stay as I am this year, then if you cannot come home I will try and go to you. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have got the Negroes all hired out except Bet and I have Tomas Finnell and his wife boarding with me and the dentist is a day boarder. He has got those offices of Weeles just above me. I cannot see how the Negroes would get along without me, for I find it no small job to take care and manage things as they should be, and that too, without means, but I am trying to do the best I can and I believe everyone will give me the credit of doing the best I can. At any rate I do the best I know for the credit and welfare of myself and family. Old brother Smith was down to see me the other day, to hear from you and to tell me he had got a letter from Emma. She had got to San Francisco and was well. The church is in rather a luke warm condition. Brother Smith preaches as usual every other Sunday. Curtis Smith has located in Louisville. His health is bad and he preaches very seldom, The sewing society meets at my house every Wednesday evening. It is pretty well attended. There has been nothing new transpiring here of late. Ii is the same dull monotonous place that is used to be. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tell John that there is a talk of Will Roy and one of them ugly Miss Downeys marrying but if they do they will have to run off, for old Downy says he shall not have her. Theodore Thornton and Mary Smarr is in love with each other. Theodore went out there last week to see her and old Smarr would not let her see him. So you see what money will do. If these boys were rich, or even energetic, the old men would not object to their daughters marrying them—but they want to live high, dress fine and do nothing</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lizzie is going to school and is growing very fast. She sends her love to you both. Tell John to write to me and tell him to bring me, when he comes home, some pretty bunches of corral and some of the curiosities from the sea and Isthmus. Dave brought Mrs Web some beautiful carob in its natural state. You must not think of coming back by land; it will take you too long. You, my sweet husband, bring me some curiosities from the sea and Isthmus.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I will bid you farewell and rest assured that I will write you every mail. I wrote you about the Wests’ busyness and Clint sent another note in one of my letters. I do hope you will get some of them yet. I sent you a good many papers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Write me often and come whenever you can, or think you ought. Farewell my precious treasures, your devoted wife until death,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> M. Haun</span></p>
