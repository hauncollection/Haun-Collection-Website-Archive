Rose Cottage, Tuesday April 3 65

Mr Haun
Ever Dear Friend
This is a bright and beautiful
morning. Cousin’s yard being, full of fruit trees looks
indeed like a picture, this lovely spring morning
with its pink, and snowy white blossoms, green grass
and [kyasynths?] and doors and windows all thrown
open, the breeze from the river is refershing
indeed, the little birds, seemes this morning
to be trying, to out carrowling, each other, in
the sweetness, of their songs, the l wives being
high, we have but to look out, when a boat passes
and we have the pleasure of waiting them which
is quite entertaining to me. We went aboard
the steamer Ruth. built here for the Miss
river, makes her first trip this week, she
cost --$210,000. we went all through her, such
splendor I never witnessed the cabins were
to look at their floors, like a mass of flowers
most splendid mirrors, berths with snowy

Dora guesses well. But you
did the emracign part
dont lay it on me I
will not stand it

[sideways right]
I had made all out what you scratched out in the other letter before you told me

linen and lace curtains. tables covered, with
[crossed out]curtains covers of Royal purple embroydered with
gold. They talk of giveing a trial trip, inviting
the citazens. Aunt Pollie says there is rather a
risk to run, and forbids us going. I guess you
will be supprised. But I have been to a
Circus. Cousin Henry said there was a great many
of the nices ladies in Lou__ there, and he
wanted us to see Roberson the champion
rider of the world, also the Arab performes
another one here, next week. We attended
the matanee saturday evening, seen Fair
clough play the iron chest. City life has
two many fasinations for me, I believe I
would go right straight to the Old scratch
and wishing to anchor in the harbor of
Heaven safely shall try and cast my lot
with those of the country proclivites whare
we can look through nature up to nature’s
God. From the tone of Your letter I shall
conclude Dora has been telling me what is
not true, You and her for it. Cousin Morris
she will excuse you in your first offend that
all of the Marys ar of an excusing and forgiving
disposition, or else she would not excuse her rebel
husband for going off. The visit to Sister Fan
will be new to me, as she has moved since
I left. Tell Dora when she quizzed you again
about our being engaged. That you do not
know whether we are, or not, that You dont
understand me land if you do I you have
the advantage of me, when I tell you
I will go with you. You talk of going
off, and if I want to see you to come
home. Well well that is a polite way of
doing a fellow. I never did understand you
and believe it is mutual. You all have little to
do to let a Negro take the place. Will Morris and
zeph were up to see me. Will told me before
he left Lexington he heard Bill Storys
wife was dead, is it so or not. I have been to
see zephs wife and found her to be a very pleasant
little woman. You send your love and
ask some in return well, I was always
was to proud to let you know that I
cared any thing for you but you must
have divined my secret [illegible] as you are not
blind or dull of comprehension. I never would
betray myself till sertain of your sentiments
But I never have believe you cared as
much for me as I care for you. Well I can
fell myself blushing now after such a speech
I never have ask you to burn a letter before
this, but please comit this to the flames. I ask
it as a request I think you should gratify
I wish if you see Dora, you would hurry them
up tell them to write that if Ma is willing
Middleton and I want to go down the river
Friday week we will stay, till the foloowing
wensday or friday, will be on the boat from
5 00, in the evening till 10 00 at night stay
all night in Gransbury Unckle Hutchins
is to meet us in the morning. tell them
to write I want to know what Ma says about
it. I shall reserve the stamps to write to you
you must directly. You get this I want to
hear from you before I go you better not
leave before I come home. have you heard
from your Ma. does she know that you

[sideways right]
are out of prison yet. I had a ride all over the city in a buggie. I am
here did not get to go. Quite soon I shall close as I am going

view I otherwise could not have had. Tell
