Dear Friend,

Yours of the 9th was received by Cousin Mary on last Saturday. I have been up to town for the last two weeks, and she would not send it to me or I should have answered it ere this. She does not allow me to stay with Cousin Mag at all and keeps my letters to get me back. I was thinking you were rather dilatory about writing but had divined your reason, which proved true on the arrival of your letter with the explanation.

You don’t see why I can't stay a little longer with my cousin, as no one is in a hurry to see me. Now don’t you want to see me? Sure enough you do to. Well I don’t care if you don’t; I want to see you any how.

Dora has been out. I guess you all had a fine time of it. But Dora is not to supplant me in Uncle Pack’s affections if she has in yours, for he used to say I was one of his favorites. And you all had several romps—well that is just like all the boy that ever visited our house. They will romp and play with her and sit back as if they had a horror of me, and I am sure I do not try to inspire such a feeling. I love as well as anyone. Dora told you the joke did she? Cousin enjoyed it finely but I was somewhat teased over it.

Dora says I have not written telling them when I was coming home. I presume my letter must have arrived after that for I have written home that I intend to start home this coming Thursday. I do not think I will allow anything to detain me that can be avoided. I want to see them all at home so bad. I never stayed away from home so long before. It looks to me like a dream; I can scarcely realize it. The Confederacy seems to have wound up in a perfect hurrah. President Davis[note]Confederate President Davis was captured with his wife on May 10 1865 in Georgia, just five days after the official disillusion of the Confederacy. By May 19 he was in prison awaiting trial for treason in Virginia. Its unclear why Mollie may have thought he was in Kentucky at the time.[/note] is to pass through here today or tomorrow. Many houses here are still draped in morning for President Lincoln.

And you have heard from home I suppose that they feel somewhat relieved now that you are allowed to roam at your pleasure. Don’t you want me to help you to drop corn? I think I would make a splendid hand don’t you, with a little instruction. A party of us visited Cave Hill Cemetery on Tuesday. It is a lovely place. I have a leaf from Courtland Prentice’s[note]William Courtland Prentice was the son of George D. Prentice, editor of the Louisville Journal. The Prentice family was one of those famously divided by the conflict, the father a prominent figure loyal to the Union and two sons serving the Confederacy. This division came to the fore when Courtland was wounded by friendly fire in Augusta, Kentucky and died in the hospital some time later. His father wrote a personal editorial eulogizing his son. The relationship was used to question George Prentice’s own loyalties.( Cashin, Joan E., pg 374)[/note] grave. Quite a number of Rebel Soldiers are buried there. Their graves are covered with flowers planted by the ladies. I also saw the box with the remains of the Kentucky Giant who lived and died at a little place near hear called Shippenport. It was a very large box indeed. He was over 7 feet tall.

I do not suppose your last letter was opened in Georgetown but it was the fault of the General that this arrived unmolested. I do not know whether or not you employed aunt Jemima’s plaster to seal it. I don’t know the name of those flowers I sent; they came out of my cousin’s yard. Consequently, I cannot tell you the emblem. Just attached some pretty emblem to them to suit yourself, and I will be satisfied.

If you get this letter in time enough to answer before I start home, do so. If you think not, it will be be all right. I shall not stop long on the way home. If you were here this morning I would make you a pretty bouquet. The yard is full of flowers—I have never seen as many roses in one place before, and such a variety. Now don’t tell me you are too busy to write, and have no time till after tea. I expect you are kept busy sparking some of the girls. I am coming home and will break up that arrangement. I don’t intend to give up of my sweethearts to the girls unless the gentleman in question is particularly anxious—then I shall not have anything else to say.

But for this morning, I shall bid you adieu. My love to Scheezicks.

As ever Your Friend,

Mollie C.B.
