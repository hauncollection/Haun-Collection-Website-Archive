<strong>Thursday 1</strong> - Some ice froze this morning, but it commenced storming. Snow and rain at intervals in the A.M.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Several ladies came over from the American Valley to the ball at Fox’s. Among them were my wife and Liz.</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">We bought the cook stove from Ed Bass at $40. It took four of us to carry it down to our new cabin. After supper we all went up to the Point to the ball. I stayed all night and slept with my wife—what a time I did sleep!</span>
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I gave Frank Goble $5. No work done in our diggins in the last two days on account of rain it has not been safe to drift.</span>

<strong>Friday 2</strong> - Snowed some last night, and snowing at intervals today. We all moved into our new cabin today. The inside is lined with canvass. The bunks were finished today, bolts and latches made of wood were put on the doors, and the boys are all gone to bed. I am alone, sitting by the stove making this entry.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I was up at the Point this P.M. and helped my wife off for the valley with the rest of the crowd that was over at the ball.</span>

<strong>Saturday 3</strong> - Cold and frosty last night. I, Dave, Kyler, and Len went up to the Point to help Sherwin on the flume. We went up to the mill, but no Sherwin. We went down to his house and found him asleep. I got him up and we all went to work the rest  of the day.

<strong>Monday 5</strong> - Cold and frosty last night again. I slept with Shults—rather crowded but the best I can do at present. Us four went to work for Sherwin today. Its getting along quite slow. There is a lack of tools, so we have to wait on each other. I’ve been patching up some work that was done the week before last. I am in hope there will be no more of that sort.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">John and Joe came down to Rocky Bar early. Joe on his way to Marysville and John off to the American Ranch, so the old mountain diggins is deserted at last, I hope only for a short time.</span>

<strong>Friday 23</strong> - The defendant, Terwilliger, is to have 10 inches of water[note]The miner's 'inch of water' is a measure particular to the Sierra Nevada gold fields. In flume mining, water was measured according to the size of the opening from the main flume, into an area where it might be used for mining a particular claim. Ten inches of water, therefore, refers to an opening in the flume with an area of 10 square inches. Miners inches were not standardized during the gold rush, since the volume of water flowing from an opening would depend upon the size and pressure of the flume.[/note] out of the disputed creek when it is there, and none when that amount is not there. Also, the disputed ditch, and the interveners are to pay cost of the intervention and get nothing, and we are to have the rest of the water in the creek at all times. When there is not 10 inches in the creek, we are to have the remainder. We are to pay the cost of the suit, except what the interveners have to pay. So may it be.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Cloudy and rainy at intervals. I gave $5 to buy butter. John and Bray went over to Nelson Creek this morning.</span>

<strong>Saturday 24</strong> - Cloudy and unpleasant. Rains planted some corn, turnip seed, beet, and parsnip seeds. I and Balloo was getting up our costs and trying to ascertain what rights are left us in the suit, &amp;c, &amp;c
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">Dave and Kyler came over about noon and have gone to Betsy Town. I collected $26 for ranching, and $4.50 from Dickson. Jim Shults came over and stayed all night.</span>

He gave me $57.50 in dust—what had been got the week before by him and Rains, and what he had washed out of the square box. We all went down to the Point.

<strong>Wednesday 28</strong> - I feel much better. I breakfasted, $.50, and got the pony shod all round, $4, and got me a gold pan cost, $3, and got some oranges, $.75.
<span style="margin-left: 28px;">I saddled up the pony and went out to H.P.‘s ranch. I paid ferriage $.50. I took dinner with Cath and children. Jack came from the upper ranch. He’d done cutting hay up there and started the machine on the lower ranch and we then started for town and met H.P. I turned back with him. He says there is considerable excitement at San Francisco occasioned by the vigilance committee and the hanging of Casey and Cora.[note]James P. Casey and Charles Cora were publicly hung by the Vigilance Committee of San Francisco May 22nd 1856 at 1:20 P.M. from the windows of the committee headquarters on Sacramento Street between Front and Davis. Both had been tried before the committee and found guilty, Casey for the murder of James King, Cora for the murder of General William H. Richardson.
