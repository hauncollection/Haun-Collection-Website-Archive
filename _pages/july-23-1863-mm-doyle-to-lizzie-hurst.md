Paris, Kentucky
July 23, 1883

My Dear Mary,

Your letter came to me too late to send for the scarf. I have been up in the mountains all the summer so far and as you will be going back by the first of August, I thought it would not do to write to San Francisco as you would not get it. If the Lord spares us next summer write do and I hope you may be located there by that time.

I will give you a letter of introduction to Mr. Murphy when you go down again. He is a wealthy man and perhaps he can use his influence for you. He is now in London, for his daughter is to be married soon to some Lord.[note]Anita Teresa Murphy, daughter of the San Francisco millionaire Daniel Murphy, married Sir Charles, Lord Wolseley in 1883.[/note]

If San Francisco was your home I would make an effort to go there. We could room together and I presume board is as cheap there as here. Do try and get a position in the city and not bury yourself in that little mountain where you have no church nor Catholic society. I think it dreadful to be so long without attending church.

I hope your teeth will not give you any more trouble. there is no pain like a tooth ache it makes me sick all over. I am more than thankful to you for the trouble you put yourself to in trying to get the scarf. I think it strange you do not hear from Mackie. If she and Jane are on friendly terms, she should not neglect her only Sister who is dearer to her than an Aunt. I can not understand how relations can live that way. I hope Mack is not sick and if she is I would think her husband would write to you. I would suppose Water would know something of her.

You must have had a pleasant visit with the sisters. I enjoy myself so much with them twins. Now I am going to Cincinnati on a day visit to the sisters and to the Mother Brants. You must have a glorious time with your country relations. Lord deliver me from such. I find it better to live among strangers. When I went to California I thought of making it my home. I always liked Jane when she was a girl, but she is not the same person, or if she is I never knew her. I could not live in a house where there is much quarreling and contention. I must and will have peace.

I met your Aunt Cath, Kate, and Mr Dewey when I was there. Mr Dewey is a nice man. I hear Emit is in Idaho. I do not think he has been successful in business.

Dear Mary, I am sorry your life has been so hard and dreary. How Jane could find it in her heart to treat orphans and her her own brother’s children unkindly I do not understand. Mollie must have a time with Patsy[note]Martha Haun[/note]. Don’t you live with a mother-in-law.

You and I better get together in San Francisco. Do you think we could live in peace as Catholics? We could I think, but I must say I have been treated worse by Catholics than any one. Give my, love to all who remember me and write me all the news of your dear self and of your future plans. I hope your visit to Santa Crus has be been of benefit to you. Tell Mollie she has forgotten to write.

I hope you will excuse this miserable pen and write often. Your letters give me so much pleasure. Send photos.

Ever your loving cousin,

M.M. Doyle
