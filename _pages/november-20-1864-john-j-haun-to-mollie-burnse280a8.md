Dear Friend,

I hardly know how to communicate lately to you, having nothing that would interest you in the least, but I hope you will excuse my letters if they are uninteresting. Your letter was not torn this time. You have not failed in your attempts to cheer me in my many dreary hours of confinement. I do assure you your letters afford me a great deal of pleasure, although they often bring news of the death of some dear friend or relative. I have lost an uncle and cousin since I have been in prison.

I suppose you are going to the wedding, of course. I wish to make a request of you and think you ought to grant it and that is that you will kiss my new cousin for me as I cannot do it myself. No excuse will be taken.

So Annie is going to marry soon. Have you heard from Sinai Harris lately. I wonder if he won’t give a big sigh as well as my cousin Charles--what do you think of it?

I shall not take back my wish concerning the weight of one hundred and sixty pounds and will bet if ever I get to Georgetown I will get a sight at somebody at all hazards and then probably I will hear that secret which has been so long denied me--but I think you ought to tell me in your next letter. You know I would tell you were the case reversed. Ask Dora if she will receive a ring from an old friend like myself. If so to let me know in your next and take one of her rings and ink the edge and press it on the paper so as I can get the size.

I must close. Is Cliff Toppas still in town or does he live in the country? It depends a great deal on what the secret is whether I would proclaim it gracious or not. Write soon to your friend and receive his best love. What has become of Frank Allghier? If you only knew how much I wanted to tell you, you would not deny me a sight of your weight.

J. J. Haun was 180
