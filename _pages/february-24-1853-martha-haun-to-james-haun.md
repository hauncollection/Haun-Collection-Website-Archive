My own Dear Husband,

I received your and my dear boy’s letter this evening. What a pleasure to read those lines, traced by your dear hands.

I am well at present and all of our family are doing as well as we could expect. Sam is breaking. Him and Betty and the children are doing well. Kitty is doing well and seems
satisfied with her home.

Wash is with me yet. Pratt does not charge me anything for his board. I found it would be a hard matter for me to get wood and water if I had to depend on their Negroes, so I concluded to keep him with me until after Betty’s confinement and hire him out. I will take Jim if I stay in town, but I do not think I shall stay much in town this summer.

Lizzie is also with me. I could not part from her too. Mr. Moore told me to keep her a while until I felt like I could give her up. I think her and me will both go to the country and spend the most of our time there, after Bet gets about.

My friends are very kind to me. They come to see me. Mrs. Johnson has been several times, and Bled and his wife. Bled says he will come for me any time and take me out to his Mother’s.

Mr. Nutter and Will was in court today. Will was married last Thursday to Mary F. Houston, daughter of Steve. She is about sixteen and very pretty, so say the people. I have not seen her, nor did I know he was married until he told me when he was here. He bought the buggy at ninety nine dollars on four months credit. Rose come to see me two or three times about the selling of it and discouraged me very much about getting much for it. I rather suspected him of wanting it for someone else, and I told him I would not take less than a hundred for it. I got George Toppas and Mr Moore to have it bid up to that and it came within one dollar of it. Jim Nutter or Will would have got it for fifty if they could. Pratt thinks it was well sold without any harness.

I have paid Newbold. I have not collected any money yet—

Sam Thompson has got back from Missouri. He makes out that after examining the piece of territory there he would not have it. This is what I have heard; I have not seen him since he got back. He does not get it.

Bled told me of a trick he payed on General Johnson to get money to take him out to Missouri. He went to Johnson and told him he had a fine lot of hemp and if he would advance him two hundred dollars that he might have hemp enough to satisfy him for it. Johnson sent his overseer to look at the hemp and he come back and said the hemp was there but when they went to haul it, it was piled up on boxes and one thing or another to make the house look pretty full when there was scarcely a hundred dollars worth there. Bled plagues the general a great deal about Sam. So you see, he is just where he started, only with a little worse name if possible. Bled says he will make him pay me. I do not know how it will be.

Nat Saunders and Gabe has got back and are preparing to go to housekeeping forthwith on the Harman place. Mrs. Saunders is staying with Betty at Owensboro. They will settle there.

Clint is fixing up the old house and moving into it. Ben Hall is selling out at cost and is going to move to Covington. John Lemon and Miss Betty Jenkins is to be married next Thursday morning, so says Mary Larue.

We had a business meeting last Saturday, but as usual not much was done. They tried
to do something with Ridsdale but they could not make him understand anything. He cried and went on like a deranged man. They had to drop the case. Harvey Graves then got up and started a conversation he had had with Finnell. Then Jeffrey got up and puffed and bellowed about his character being unimpeachable and he defied anyone to say ought against his character, that he could and would prove as good a one as any man. They have appointed a committee of ten to wait on him and Finnell. In the other case of the child he will plead guilty and ask forgiveness, so I think some that have talked with him about it. I assure you he is very low in the estimation of this community—

Tell dear Dave I am thankful to him for his miniature—that Liz and I kiss it often and shed our tears together over it. Oh, it seemed to bring him back to us again. Tell him I will cherish it as a dear loved one while I live.

My dear I will not attempt to describe my feelings since you have left. It would be in vain for me to attempt it. Suffice to say, if you like it out there, you and John, well enough to make it your home, just let me know and oh how quick will I go—for this world is a blank without you. I must and will live with you what time I have to stay in this world. Oh God, how dear you are to me, God only knows. My happiness, my life itself, seems wrapped <span style="line-height: 1.5;">up in you and John and dear Dave. I want to be with all of you, and at the same time our </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">servants is also very near to me. They are a poor, helpless, dependent race, and ours is so kind to me that it would go hard with me to part from them. But exercise your own judgement and I will be governed by it.</span>

You will I know, love, write to me often. As for my dear dear child, tell him I will write him in a few days and say to him keep up his spirits and not give way to melancholy let what will come, for it has never done anyone any good, but a great deal of harm. Tell him I read his letter and kissed it and watered it with my tears. I will pray for him and you, and pray and hope that we will meet again. There seems to be so much interest manifested for you here. I cannot begin to name the persons that send their love to you, There has been at least a hundred that say give my love to you and John.

Farewell, while I remain, your devoted wife,

Martha Haun
