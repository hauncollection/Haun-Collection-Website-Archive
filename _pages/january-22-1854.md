My Dear Sweet husband--

I have determined to
write you every week-- in hopes you will get some of
my letters-- for I preceive you do not get near all of
my letters I know I get all that you &amp; John writes. I can
tell by the way you write-- it is the same case with
mary Lared &amp; Mrs Shorme- they say their husbands does
not get all their letters but they get theirs-- we have
had a verry pleasant winter so far no verry cold weather
this is I think the coldest day we have had-- but yesterday we
set all day with out fire- it was like an April day. I do
not think I ever saw more rain fall in the same length
of time than fell last knight yesterday &amp; knight before last
with a great deal of lighting &amp; thunder-- but cleared off very
cold- when I write so often I have verry little news
to write you-- Ben Bradly got home from the south last
knight he has been thers setting up his wifes business
they talk of going to St Lewis in the spring to settle--
Mrs Saunders is pleased with Mo &amp; has brought a farm in
12 miles of Bob Keene-- Green Tucker gets married in a
week or two to a Miss Morrison who lives at squires
Kemps &amp; is some kin to the KEmps She is a poor but verry
nice pretty girl of a bout 22 years of age. he told me
him self a bout his going to get married &amp; said he would
start immediately after his message to Mo to settle there
in fact there is verry little change in the place any way
since  you left. some have sold out- I have writ
you all the charges in that way the talk is now
that Alvin Duvall is verry much involved &amp; will have
to sell his property I know not how it is whether there
is any truth in it or no- one thing I do know his wife
is as extravagent as if she was worth thousands--
the Gorgetown Hotel has the run of customs all summer
it has been crowded-- while Pratt has not more
than eight or ten regular boarders at no time---
Pratt has acted the Intetan to wards me from
first to last since you left &amp; now he seems anxious
to accomodate me in any way he can but every one
dispises his wife &amp; respects him highly-- I wrote
you that High Sullivan had bought Mrs Reeds
property at a thousand dls- I have written you
every thing as it transpired that would interest you
in the least. I have got in Dr Meets &amp; his wife
the kindest friends they seem to think a great deal
of me-- in fact I have no reason to complain for
every one is kind to me. I have every reason to love
the people of Georgetown &amp; I do feel more attached to
it than I ever did before in my life- the way
I am living is as pleasant &amp; I think more so than
any other I know of in your absence it would
seem to be a lonesome way to any one to think of it
but I do not feel as lonesome as I did when I had
to mix with a people I cared nothing a bout---
bets Holtzclaw Ethan Finnell &amp; Laura Miller has all been to
Frankfort- &amp; spent two weeks a plying a round there to
catch beaus but I do not think they succeeded but is going back

they will make seveteen hundred dols a year there probably
more-- this is tuesday knight the 24th I commenced this on
saturday knight the 21st Sunday knight I had one of my
old spells of sick headache- I was taken directly after diner on
Sunday &amp; was verry sick all knight but as usual got up well
or nearly so the next morning-- yesterday &amp; last knight was verry
near as cold as the cold spell we had last winter a year a go
but to day it is cloudy &amp; looks like snow &amp; my feet had like
to have frozen last knight I get up three times &amp; warmed my
petticoat &amp; wrap them up- liz is of no account of a cold
fright to keep my feet warm- oh how I missed you &amp;
wished you were laying by me. my dear if ever I get
your sweet form by me a gain you ever shal leave
me if only for one knight &amp; I know I wouldnot go &amp;
leave you a knight for nothing on earth this seperation
will make me foolish a bout you as long as I live
for I have found out that I love your letter than all the
world beside. except my child- my husband you
little dream how devotedly I love. I did not know my self
this strength of my love for you- but oh if god will only
permit me to see you a gain- I will stick closer to you
the ballance of my life than woman did to man on earth
may god speed the happy day when I will a gain hear that
sweet familliar would &amp; set &amp; gaze in that lovely face &amp; feel a gain
